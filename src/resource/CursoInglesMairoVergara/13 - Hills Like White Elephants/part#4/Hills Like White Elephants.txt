"It's really an awfully simple operation, Jig," the man said.

"It's not really an operation at all."

The girl looked at the ground the table legs rested on.

"I know you wouldn't mind it, Jig.

It's really not anything.

It's just to let the air in."

The girl did not say anything.

"I'll go with you and I'll stay with you all the time.

They just let the air in and then it's all perfectly natural."

"Then what will we do afterward?"

"We'll be fine afterward. Just like we were before."

"What makes you think so?"

"That's the only thing that bothers us.

It's the only thing that's made us unhappy."

The girl looked at the bead curtain,

put her hand out and took hold of two of the strings of beads.

"And you think then we'll be all right and be happy."

"I know we will. You don't have to be afraid.

I've known lots of people that have done it."

"So have I," said the girl.

"And afterward they were all so happy."
