Oh, hey.

11
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,595
Judy, Jesus Christ.
What are you doing in here?

12
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,306
Just keeping Steve company.

13
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,891
Okay.

14
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,978
And playing ocean sounds because...

15
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,479
'Cause I can't sleep.

16
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,356
And I don't think Steve can either.

17
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,775
Okay. I think he's asleep.

18
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,736
Hon, I think he's the most asleep.

19
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,323
Look, Judy, you can't be out here
in the middle of the night

20
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,741
snuggling a freezer.

21
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,137
I mean, what if one of the boys walked in?
What would they think?

22
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,245
Okay, well, I'm sorry,

23
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,915
but it seems wrong to have him
out here alone, trapped in this thing.

24
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,919
Okay. I know that it's not
the ideal situation,

25
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,422
but we agreed, remember?

26
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,007
- Yeah.
- That the freezer

27
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,050
is the safest place to keep him...

28
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,886
...at least for now, right?

29
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,264
Right. I just didn't know that I was gonna
feel this way.

30
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,975
I don't think this is what Steve wants.

31
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,894
Oh, God. "What Steve wants."

32
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,314
I was in my room,
and suddenly, I smelled sea fennel

33
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,815
- and cypress.
- That's horrible.

34
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,025
That's his body wash.

35
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,151
Oh.

36
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,777
So then I come in here,

37
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,946
and that motion light is already on.

38
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,991
- It's a sign.
- Of what?

39
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,868
That he doesn't want to be here.

40
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,244
Okay.

41
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,079
He hated confined spaces.

42
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,749
Elevators scared him. Sorry.

43
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,979
- He was sensitive about that.
- Okay.

44
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,005
Listen, Judy, you have got to find a way
to put this out of your mind

45
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,692
- so that you can start...
- I just want to stay here for a minute.

46
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,885
You need to start to move on.

47
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,719
Okay?

48
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,766
How do I move on when he's frozen
50 feet from where I sleep every night?

49
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,310
I don't know.
You have to compartmentalize, okay?

50
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,728
Just try not to think about it.

51
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,481
It's not what I'm thinking,
it's about what I'm feeling.

52
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,445
- That was weird.
- That was Steve.

53
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,075
I'm just saying, spirits have been known
to communicate through lights.

54
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,368
It's a documented thing.

55
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,912
Okay, you know what else
communicates through lights?

56
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:07,996
Electricity.

57
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,167
I know it's hard for you to go there
with the spirit thing,

58
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,502
'cause it scares you.

59
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,380
That doesn't scare me.
Rotting in a women's prison scares me.

60
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,216
Yeah. I bet those places
are riddled with ghosts.

61
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,360
Judy, I have enough going on

62
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,487
without you projecting your spiritual shit
on everything.

63
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,345
- Okay?
- Okay.

64
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,266
See? No need to<i> Sixth Sense</i> ourselves
into a fucking heart attack.

65
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,648
Maybe there's something wrong
with the sensor.

66
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,836
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, I heard that.

67
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,949
Oh, God.

68
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,203
- Shh!
- I...

69
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,539
I am shushing.

70
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,625
- Do you think that he's... in there?
- No, no, he's not.

71
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,043
He's... he's not.

72
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,047
- What are you doing?
- I'm just...

73
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,484
- See what's going on here.
- Oh, no. Be careful.

74
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,926
You know I don't like the grabbing.

75
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,139
- Be careful.
- You're breathing really loud.

76
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,056
Thank you.

77
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,565
Okay.

78
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:29,454
Oh, my God! No! No, no!

79
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,622
- No! No!
- No, don't hurt 'em!

80
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,714
Yeah, you definitely got rats.

81
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,258
- Oh, yeah, we know that.
- We met them.

82
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,468
- See this?
- Uh-huh.

83
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,553
How it's kind of, like,
round on the edges?

84
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,930
Mouse droppings are sharper.
It's the anal glands.

85
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,951
- Doesn't seem like necessary information.
- I didn't know that. Interesting.

86
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,643
Uh, so how do we get rid of them?

87
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,980
Seal off points of entry,
set some bait traps. Pretty basic.

88
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,899
But is it normal that there are so many?

89
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,525
It's the heat, brah.

90
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,152
Brah, it's the heat.

91
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,278
Brah, I know.

92
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,864
Rats can't regulate their body temp.

93
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,867
They find a cool place, they set up camp,
especially if there's food.

94
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,410
You got meat in here?

95
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,955
Uh, yeah, there's some special things
in there.

96
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,039
Yeah, 'cause they can smell blood
from a mile away.

97
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,126
They can't get in there, right?

98
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,253
Wrong.

99
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,547
They got fucking razor-sharp teeth, dude.

100
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,424
They'll Shawshank their way
through anything.

101
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,847
Okay.

102
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,725
Oh, my God.

103
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,929
- Don't touch that.
- I know.

104
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,580
Really? On top of everything else,

105
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,232
now we have a swarm of fucking rats
we have to deal with?

106
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,650
I'm telling you, it's a sign.

107
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,568
What, that the world's melting?

108
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,197
No. That we have to move Steve
before the rats tunnel in.

109
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,241
- How do we do that, Judy?
- I don't know.

110
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,004
But I think we should
explore some options.

111
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,494
No, don't go in the Google!

112
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,955
The FBI can trace your phone.

113
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,582
Shit. How else do we figure out what
to do with a dead body?

114
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,306
I don't know. All I can think about
is stuff that happens in movies

115
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,670
that involve, like, wood chippers

116
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,256
or dissolving a body in a bathtub
with whatever it is

117
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,966
they dissolve bodies in bathtubs with.

118
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,260
- We are not doing that!
- No.

119
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,388
No, I was giving examples
of things we wouldn't do.

120
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,892
There is a beautiful Thai Buddhist ritual
where they wash the body hands first...

121
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,061
- We could put him in a suitcase.
- Jen!

122
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,147
That is the man I was gonna marry.

123
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,398
Okay, I'm...

124
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,484
I'm sorry.
I'm just exploring options here.

125
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,654
What about a burial at sea, hmm?

126
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,948
Steve loved the ocean.
He was such a strong swimmer.

127
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,741
Okay, that is lovely,

128
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,493
but I don't have a boat,

129
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,037
and I don't have time
to get my captain's license.

130
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,330
Okay, but we can rent one.

131
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:40,209
No, because then the FBI will know
that we rented a boat.

132
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,754
I really think that we moved too fast
past the suitcase.

133
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,838
Jen.

134
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,925
He's a person who lived a life.

135
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,803
I think his soul deserves
to be put to rest with dignity.

136
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,346
- Dignity?
- Yes.

137
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,683
Judy, he left Ted to die.

138
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,643
He used you to launder money.

139
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,062
He... he dumped you
after five miscarriages.

140
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,398
- I know, but...
- No, he is a monster!

141
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,525
Why are you worried about his soul?

142
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,110
You should be worried about us.

143
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,904
- Because I owe it to him.
- Why?

144
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,448
Because it's my fault that he's dead.

145
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,827
No, no, you weren't...

146
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,120
You weren't even there.

147
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,372
I brought him into your life.

148
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:19,999
I turned him in, but...

149
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,252
I never thought he would get angry enough
to try to kill you.

150
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,798
<i>Why, you are a mean fucking bitch.</i>

151
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,310
- It's not your fault.
- It is.

152
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,854
It is. It's my karma.

153
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,942
- It's what I get.
- No, no.

154
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,195
No, it's not... It's not your karma.

155
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,820
I promise.

156
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,075
Listen, we...

157
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,663
will get rid of the rats, okay?

158
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,665
- Okay.
- Okay.

159
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,001
Then what do we do about him?
He cannot stay in there forever.

160
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,794
No, I mean...

161
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,838
not forever, it's...

162
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,050
Maybe...

163
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,179
Maybe just until the boys go to college,
you know, just...

164
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,474
in case I have to go away.

165
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,143
They'll be okay on their own.

166
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,564
I mean, it's only seven years.

167
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,607
That's a really long time.

168
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,818
I don't know what else to fucking do.

169
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,120
I just don't know
if we could live like this.

170
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:32,988
We have to.

171
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:39,078
You know, I gotta say,
every time we're in this house,

172
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,205
the more perfect the two
of you look in it.

173
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,957
Or should I say the three of you?

174
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,250
Yeah.

175
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,211
I hope you don't think we're paranoid
for taking one last look.

176
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,340
Oh, God, no. Not at all.
I mean, this is gonna be your house.

177
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,801
And now that the offer's been accepted,

178
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,220
you can start planning how
to make it yours, you know,

179
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,782
what window treatments you're gonna get,
maybe get some built-ins.

180
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,966
We're having second thoughts.

181
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:00,850
Come again?

182
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,644
The inspection showed that there was mold
in the bathroom.

183
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:08,024
Oh, yeah, yeah. I saw that.
It's really not that big of a deal.

184
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,067
It's black mold.

185
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,987
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but it's, like, trace amount,

186
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,780
which is basically nothing.

187
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,115
Well, if it was nothing,

188
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,784
then the inspector would have said
he found nothing.

189
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,703
Hmm. Yeah. You know,

190
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,041
I feel that sometimes inspectors think
that they have to find something

191
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,209
because you paid for the inspection.

192
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,293
You know what I mean?

193
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,170
Not really.

194
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,189
We can pull out of escrow
if we want, right?

195
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,884
It's just, with a baby, we feel like
we need to be extra careful, you know?

196
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,512
- Oh, no, I get it. I get it. I'm a mom.
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,056
But honestly,

198
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,517
I think we worry about stuff
that no one used to care about.

199
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,021
My mom smoked heavily
through her entire pregnancy,

200
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,357
and I'm, you know, fucking awesome.

201
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:53,444
I just feel like because I know that
that mold is there...

202
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,945
It's just so hard to remove.

203
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,281
...I won't be able to think
about anything else.

204
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,700
Look, no place is perfect.

205
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,871
You're not gonna find a house that
doesn't have shit that you have to ignore.

206
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,958
I mean, I wish that black mold was
the worst thing going on in my house.

207
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,505
'Cause I have rats.

208
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,838
Oh.

209
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,843
No, I know, Lorna.

210
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,346
Yes, I told them that
trace is basically nothing.

211
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,141
You know what? I don't know
what else to tell you.

212
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,727
It... it's not my fault
that they're fucking pussies

213
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,063
that want to protect the life
of their unborn child.

214
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,732
Bye.

215
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,798
What the fuck?

216
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,597
Fuck you, Steve.

217
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,697
Get me out of here.

218
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,408
Mom, please calm down, okay?
Please, just...

219
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,661
You can't keep me in this place.
I want to go home.

220
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,873
I know, I know you do,
but you can't live alone anymore.

221
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,541
And this is a really nice place.

222
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,501
There's, like, a year-long waiting list.

223
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,795
If you love it so much, <i>you</i> live here.

224
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,423
I'd be sad to see you go, Flo.

225
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,758
I wasn't talking to you.

226
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,844
Yeah, but your voice
kind of carries, so...

227
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,764
- Ballsy.
- Yeah.

228
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,144
I realized that I forgot to tell you
that I teach a painting class.

229
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,021
Tuesdays and Thursdays at nine.

230
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,231
Mom, you might like that.
That sounds cool.

231
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,482
"Cool."

232
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,691
Did you paint that?

233
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,613
Uh, no, I don't really do seascapes.

234
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,656
Well, good, 'cause it's awful.

235
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,492
She's an art critic.

236
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,786
Oh, you're right. She's got a good eye.

237
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,496
I mean, like, what the hell, right?

238
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,997
- Yeah.
- Who did that?

239
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,665
I'm gonna get rid of it.

240
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,752
Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

241
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,838
- You're just gonna take it?
- Yeah. You don't like it, it's out.

242
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,924
- You didn't like it, Mom.
- Yeah.

243
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,302
Who knows what I'm gonna do with it?
I'm just lawless. I'm crazy.

244
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,138
Oh.

245
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,866
It's okay, right?
You really don't want it?

246
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,308
No, you can take it.

247
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,561
Hey.

248
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,524
- Um, thank you for that. I appreciate it.
- Oh, sure.

249
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:40,110
And I apologize.
Uh, my mom is tough stuff.

250
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,445
Oh, stop, she's not that bad.

251
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,322
- Well, she's not your mom.
- No.

252
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,615
My mom's a drug addict.

253
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:45,991
So there's that.

254
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,369
- Touché.
- Um...

255
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,080
You know, a lot of residents
hate it here at first,

256
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,540
but then they start to like it.

257
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,875
- Just makes it hard on the families.
- Yeah.

258
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,377
Can I get you anything?

259
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,795
You want a coffee

260
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,048
or a pudding or weed?

261
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,216
- There you go.
- Yes.

262
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,979
I was wondering when you would share that.

263
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,095
I was hoping you'd be wondering.

264
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,084
<i>Why?</i>

265
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,059
<i>What did you do?</i>

266
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,281
<i>♪ I fucking hate everyone ♪</i>

267
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,867

<i>♪ Eliminate hypocrisy ♪</i>

273
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,053
No, shit, shit, shit, shit!

274
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,096
Why are you trying
to get rid of a dead body?

275
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,598
Oh, God. Jesus, Shandy.

276
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,433
Um, I'm not... I'm not...

277
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,477
Uh, I'm not trying
to get rid of a dead body.

278
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,228
I was, uh... That was, uh, autofill.

279
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,066
- Getting rid of a freezer.
- Okay.

280
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,402
Why are you here?

281
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,780
- Playdate. Henry's in the bathroom.
- Oh, right. Okay.

282
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,949
Yeah, I didn't realize that was today.

283
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,665
If I were gonna get rid of a dead body,
I'd put it in Angeles Forest.

284
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,292
- Wait, what?
- It's where gangs dump their dead.

285
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,878
They say there's more bodies there
than trees.

286
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,923
Oh, Shandy, how do...
why do you know that?

287
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,759
I read about it on the dark web.
It's a good resource.

288
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,011
Okay, gosh, you really just... You have...

289
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,056
You got a lot going on up in there,
don't you?

290
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,309
Wait, what's your dad's deal again?

291
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,310
He lives off the grid.

292
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,687
That was it.

293
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,939
Hey. Wanna swim?

294
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,857
I'm kind of an indoor child.

295
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,318
Okay, we could do karaoke.
You like to sing?

296
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,404
Does a praying mantis eat its own mate?

297
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,114
- It does.
- Okay.

298
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,283
Oh. Okay, cool. Let's go.

299
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,494
Oh, my God.

300
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,455
Dark web. That's so dumb.

301
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,882
Oh, God. Sick world.

302
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,429
All right. Dark web.

303
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,473
"The... dark... web."

304
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,060
If I'm being honest,

305
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,247
I thought it was, like,
the good daughter thing to do,

306
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,772
but it was rough.

307
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,692
Oh, wow, so she was living with you?

308
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,987
Yeah, for a year.
It was a complete disaster.

309
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,449
We were at each other's throats.

310
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,285
It's amazing that you tried.
Most people don't.

311
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,747
Yeah, well, we're Cuban. It's what we do.

312
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,623
Oh, I didn't realize that.

313
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,207
But, um...

314
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,336
then she broke her hip
while I was at work, so...

315
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,589
I just can't leave her alone anymore.

316
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,175
I'm sorry she's so unhappy here.

317
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:35,054
Please. She's unhappy everywhere.

318
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,806
It's like she gave up on joy
when my dad died.

319
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,852
Sorry, this is not exactly fun banter.

320
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,854
Well, sometimes you don't want fun banter.

321
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,439
Sometimes you just want...

322
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,732
Depressing chitchat?

323
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:51,070
Oh, I am so here for a sad chat.

324
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,863
You have no idea.

325
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,868
Honestly...

326
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,286
it sucks.

327
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,249
My mom used to be so... cool.

328
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,668
She was funny...

329
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,671
...and, like, vibrant.

330
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,049
And it's like, after my dad, she just...

331
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,635
withdrew, you know?

332
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:19,139
Like, she felt guilty being happy
or something, like it was a betrayal.

333
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,227
I mean, yeah, I get that.

334
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,020
I don't. I think it's selfish.

335
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,648
Really?

336
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,108
I mean, come on, like,

337
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,610
we're all gonna die at some point,
you know?

338
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,571
It's life. It's what happens.

339
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,241
But the world keeps going, and...

340
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,160
other people need you.

341
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,723
It's like you have a choice:

342
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,291
You either go down with the ship or...

343
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,921
you grab a fucking life raft
and you hold on, you know?

344
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,966
Yeah. Yes.

345
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,760
Wow. Yes.

346
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,639
It's like in <i>Titanic,</i> like,
do you want to be Leo,

347
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,600
or do you want to be the old lady
who lives forever?

348
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,059
Well, I mean,

349
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:09,064
I definitely want to be the old lady,
but I'm not quite sure she lives forever.

350
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,692
She doesn't?

351
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,946
No. Her heart will go on and on...

352
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,866
...but pretty sure her body gives out
at some point.

353
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,661
Aw, man, I really misunderstood
that movie as a kid.

354
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,425
What do we do?

355
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,192
Mom.

356
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,919
Where's the peanut butter?

357
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,143
What are you doing in here?
Honey, that door was locked.

358
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,530
No, it wasn't.

359
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,990
What's with the oven mitts?

360
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,367
Okay, I need you guys to get out of here.

361
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,995
- Why?
- Because... because it's not safe.

362
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,580
- Why?
- Because we have rats.

363
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,850
Will you please stop asking?
I need you to get out of here.

364
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,042
When did we get rats?

365
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,835
Did you know that rats' teeth
never stop...

366
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,171
Okay, I just need you
to get the fuck out of here!

367
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,134
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,094
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry I yelled.

369
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,805
Okay, I'm just...
I'm a little stressed right now.

370
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,598
What, um...

371
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,267
What did you need?

372
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,519
You wanted peanut butter?

373
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,480
- No.
- You want me to make you a snack?

374
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,314
- No?
- No.

375
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,401
Let's see if Cooper's home
across the street.

376
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,237
He might be done with Hebrew school.

377
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,920
Can I help you?

378
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,256
Um... um...

379
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,342
If I wanted... if I, uh...

380
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,679
like, needed to dissolve...

381
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,138
Something stuck in your pipes?

382
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,933
Yeah. Yeah, something's stuck.

383
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,143
This will dissolve anything,
including your skin.

384
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,436
You'll probably want to grab

385
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,147
some chemically resistant gloves
and a mask just to be safe.

386
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,525
- Okay.
- And don't cheap out.

387
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,486
Okay, no. Just the best ones.

388
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,889
- The best one's right there?
- Yeah, this one right here..

389
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,532
That one's great, too.

390
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,616
- Okay, so just...
- Yeah.

391
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,452
- There's a lot of stuff stuck.
- Yeah. Go for it.

392
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,416
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Have a great day.

393
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,664
It's just... it's some hair.

394
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,417
It's just, like, a big bunch of hair,
but I don't like that.

395
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,180
- Good luck.
- Bye, thank you.

396
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,115
- Hey, Jen.
- Oh, fuck!

397
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,593
- Are you all right?
- Fuck, you scared me. Yeah.

398
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,078
- What's with the glove? What's that smell?
- I'm cleaning.

399
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,372
No, don't go in there, no...
No, Judy, don't...

400
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,625
- Oh, my God.
- No.

401
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,721
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Now, Judy...

402
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,173
- Oh, my God!
- Listen...

403
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,634
- No, no, no. It was a rat.
- Open the freezer.

404
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,345
- I want to see him!
- No, you don't. It was just a rat.

405
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,430
You don't want to see him.

406
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,723
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

407
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,910
How can I trust you
when you were upstairs with that...

408
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,685
He's in here, okay?

409
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,354
He's in here. I was just...

410
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:21,024
I was just trying something,
because you're right, I can't do this.

411
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:24,212
I can't do this. I have to get him out of
this house. I have to get him out of here.

412
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,880
What happened to
"wait until the kids are in college"?

413
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,698
Do you realize how long that is?
Henry's fucking ten!

414
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,951
I know, it's a ridiculously long time.

415
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,434
That's why I was coming to tell you

416
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,014
that whatever you wanna do, I will do.

417
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,039
But if that is what you want to do,

418
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,667
- I won't do that.
- No, I don't want to do that!

419
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,210
I don't know what I want to do!

420
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,754
I don't know what to do.
I'm freaking the fuck out here.

421
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,297
Henry came in here today.

422
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,384
- I had the freezer open, and he almost...
- Oh, my God!

423
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,927
What if he saw something, Judy?

424
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,387
- What if he saw something?
- Okay.

425
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,805
You know what? He didn't.

426
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,598
- You're okay.
- No, I'm not okay.

427
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,201
I'm not okay. I don't know how to do this.

428
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,394
I don't know how to do it either.

429
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,396
- But you did it.
- I did what?

430
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,024
The thing, the...
living here with me after Ted,

431
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,901
pretending that everything was fine.

432
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,071
Oh, honey, nothing was fine.

433
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,282
It was awful.

434
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,118
It was terrible. I couldn't do it.

435
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,619
I had to tell you the truth.

436
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,377
<i>Why, you are a mean fucking bitch.</i>

437
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,716
Why?

438
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,892
Judy, I have something...

439
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,436
I have something that I...

440
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,896
- What the fuck?
- Whoa.

441
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,985
Ow! Fucking cunt.

442
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,614
- Are you okay?
- Fuck, yeah, I'm fine.

443
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,073
Looks like the whole block is out.

444
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,118
Huh? Oh, God, great.
On the hottest day of the year.

445
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,537
Oh, my God. Judy.

446
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,538
The freezer.

447
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,791
He could thaw.

448
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,627
- We gotta get him out of there.
- How?

449
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,587
Um, it's Christopher.

450
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,046
Hey.

451
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,924
Yeah, yeah, us too.

452
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,674
Really?

453
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,719
He said half the county's down.

454
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,907
Yeah. Uh, yeah, thank you.
Yeah, we'll call if we need anything.

455
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,558
And you call if you...

456
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,621
Okay, good, 'cause I really don't have
the capacity to help anyone right now.

457
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,645
All right, bye.

458
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,146
Oh, shit.

459
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,066
Hey.

460
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,527
- Did I scare you?
- Yes, you are terrifying.

461
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,237
- Good job.
- Okay, where's Henry?

462
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,488
I'm right here.

463
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,990
- Okay.
- Look. I'm invisible.

464
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,074
- That's great. That's amazing.
- Me, too.

465
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,535
Cute.

466
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,415
I might have a new plan.

467
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,551
- Are you sure that this is...
- No.

468
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,844
Not at all.

469
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,104
Oh, wait, I feel like you were gonna
say something earlier.

470
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,105
Was I?

471
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,317
Yeah, right when the power went off.

472
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:11,986
Oh.

473
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:13,862
Yeah, um...

474
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:19,661
I just wanted to tell you
that I forgive you.

475
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,000
Just thought you should know that.
