1
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,024
Hey.

2
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,819
I was looking all over for you.

3
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,592
How long ago did you leave the vigil?

4
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,032
Not long ago enough.

5
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,700
Okay.

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,369
Well, that's a nice jacket.

7
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,912
Oh, shit, it's...

8
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,957
It's Ben's. He gave it to me,
and I forgot to give it back to him.

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,751
Oh, what else did he give you?

10
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:45,837
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,589
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,175
Okay, uh, you know what?

13
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:54,012
I'm really exhausted, and I think
that you are on the dark side of drunk.

14
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:57,015
I think I'm on the dark side of the truth.

15
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,225
Okay, I don't know what that means.

16
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,829
- Look, let's just...
- Think about it.

17
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,063
I can't. It doesn't make any sense.

18
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,946
So let's just...
Why don't we call it a night?

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,234
I need two minutes where I don't feel like
the fucking walls are caving in on me.

20
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,237
- All right, so let's...
- Why did you have Steve Wood's car?

21
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,615
Uh...

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,577
'Cause...

23
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,125
So he just gave it to you?

24
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,543
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

25
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,505
Who just gives someone
an $80,000 Mercedes?

26
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,633
That is a great follow-up question,
and I will answer it.

27
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,759
The answer is...

28
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,554
I was about to close a really big deal
with Steve,

29
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,140
and he pulled out last minute,

30
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,392
so, uh... he felt bad.

31
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,310
Yeah, super bad.

32
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:46,689
Yeah, so he gave me the car as, like,
an apology for bailing on out.

33
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,233
He's really, really generous.

34
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,569
Then he goes missing...

35
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,072
...and we hadn't switched over the title.

36
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,617
So I put it into storage

37
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,620
until that whole thing plays out,
which could be...

38
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,372
Many, many years.

39
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,624
- And many never even happen.
- No.

40
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,167
Well, how did it get burned?

41
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,586
Well, it wouldn't start,

42
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,713
and then your mom left it
on the side of the road.

43
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,298
Yeah, 'cause I thought it'd be fine.

44
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,884
You know how people love
to burn cars on the side of the road.

45
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,969
Not really.

46
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,972
Yeah, really. People are a fucking mess.

47
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,057
Yeah. Sad.

48
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,077
Well, then shouldn't we go to the police?

49
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,221
Right? At least tell them that Steve
wasn't the one driving the car that night?

50
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,273
That's the right thing to do, right?

51
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,483
- Eh, I mean, I'd...
- Or no?

52
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,361
- Hey, I'd love to do the right thing.
- Me too.

53
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,030
Um, but, kiddo,

54
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,866
we go to the cops,

55
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,951
we're gonna have to tell them

56
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,494
that you were driving the car,

57
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,788
and you would get into a lot of trouble,

58
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,124
and you would never, ever

59
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,918
- get your license, so...
- No.

60
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,336
You're right.

61
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,714
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah.

62
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,424
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

63
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,843
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,929
Aww, baby, baby, no, I know.
I know. I'm sorry.

65
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:00,930
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

66
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,516
- But it's like, it's okay.
- It is.

67
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,726
We fuck up, you know?

68
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:08,771
- We all fuck up. Mm-hmm.
- Everybody, a lot of times.

69
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,982
Okay, well...

70
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,482
Yeah.

71
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,862
Just don't take it all on you,
you know what I mean?

72
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,423
- On your shoulders. Night, babe.
- No.

73
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,927
- Sleep tight.
- Good night.

74
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,356
- Oh, my God, I'm gaslighting my own kid.
- Oh!

75
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,705
I'm lying to him.
I'm lying to everyone all the time.

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,333
Okay, but you know what?
You don't have to lie to me.

77
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,585
- Okay?
- Hmm?

78
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,670
I saw you kissing Ben, okay?

79
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,176
That was... he kissed me.

80
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,802
It meant nothing.

81
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,763
Okay, but it seems a little unfair to me

82
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,514
since you told me I can't date Michelle

83
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,958
because of the proximity to Perez,

84
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,310
but then you can just
mack out all you want with Ben.

85
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,063
Okay, well, I'm not gonna be
"macking out" with him ever again.

86
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,231
Well, that's too bad,

87
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,525
because in a normal world,
you guys would make a really good couple.

88
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,946
Well, we don't live in a normal world.

89
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,613
Not anymore.

90
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,158
And it's Ben.

91
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,952
It's Steve's fucking brother.

92
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,205
It's Steve's fucking sweet brother. Okay?

93
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,375
Hey, you know what?
Crazier things have happened.

94
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,835
No, literally they have not.

95
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,257
Look, he's coming in the morning
to look at some rentals,

96
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,676
and I'm gonna tell him that
that was a mistake,

97
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,511
and I can't work with him anymore.

98
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,428
If it didn't mean anything,

99
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,306
- why can't you work with him anymore?
- Look, I don't want Ben.

100
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,557
I don't want anyone.

101
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,726
I'm, like, done with all of that.

102
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:30,978
Well, I'm not.

103
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,816
And what? We're just never supposed
to be happy again?

104
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,608
Just because we...

105
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,945
did some bad things,

106
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,780
we don't deserve love?

107
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,250
You do.

108
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,002
You deserve love.

109
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,588
- So do you.
- No...

110
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,340
Oh, God, I don't know about that.

111
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,424
I do.

112
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,886
Look, if you want to be with Michelle...

113
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,055
I can't stand in your way.

114
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,350
I want you to have whatever you want.

115
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,520
Okay? Just...

116
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,231
stay out of Perez's way.

117
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,149
Okay?

118
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,359
- Okay.
- Don't get all confessy.

119
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,404
I'm gonna be so careful.

120
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,031
- Okay.
- Okay.

121
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,243
- I love you.
- I love you too.

122
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,625
Seriously, don't say anything.

123
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:35,960
- Okay.
- Okay?

124
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,046
'Cause you can get very leaky
out your mouth.

125
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,839
I'm not gonna get leaky.

126
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,632
- Thank you.
- Okay.

127
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,133
You're drunk.

128
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,887
Just a little bit now.
That sobered me up a little.

129
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,130
- You did. You kind of pulled it together.
- Thank you.

130
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,809
Steve Wood tip line.

131
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,102
Ma'am...

132
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,480
Yeah.

133
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,690
Ma'am, I can't hear a word you're saying.

134
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,234
I need you to step away
from the garbage disposal, please.

135
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,236
Yeah... Yeah, it's the garbage...

136
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,033
- My man.
- Oh. Chief Hastings. Hi.

137
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,618
How's it going?

138
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,372
Any solid leads?

139
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,541
Uh, define "solid."

140
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,045
I mean, having a guy go missing
with an identical twin walking around

141
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,215
present its own, uh... challenges.

142
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:26,511
Well, if you're not up for the challenge,
I could put someone else on this, Prager.

143
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,263
I didn't say that. Uh...

144
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,892
I'm just saying,
this reward thing, it's tricky.

145
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,686
$100,000, it makes people see
what they wanna see.

146
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:40,733
Well, what I wanna see is some justice
for Steve Wood.

147
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,945
- He's a good guy from a good family.
- Hmm.

148
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,949
Then why is the FBI investigating him
for money laundering?

149
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:48,950
A better question is,

150
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,203
why did his ex-fiancée turn him in
and then drain his bank account?

151
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,373
Oh, that's another question,
not sure if it's better.

152
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,456
It's better.

153
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,586
Judy Hale is a bitter,
conniving grifter out for money,

154
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,755
and my hunch says revenge.

155
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,131
Really?

156
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,219
You think an arts-and-crafts teacher
for old folks is a better suspect

157
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,304
than the Greek Mafia he's working for?

158
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,603
The Greek Mafia.

159
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,896
Uh-huh.

160
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,650
Prager...

161
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,571
you're not starting to lose it again,
are you?

162
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,572
Tsk.

163
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,825
Hmm.

164
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,619
Answer the phone, bro.

165
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,496
I'm starting to worry about you.

166
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,292
I'm not your bro, homie.

167
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,463
Steve Wood tip line.

168
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,217
You saw him on horseback. Huh.

169
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,345
What kind of horse?

170
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,693
- Hi.
- Hi.

171
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,694
Hi.

172
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:10,156
I tried to call, but then I was like,
this is an in-person thing.

173
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,449
Have you been drinking?

174
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,532
Sure.

175
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,993
Did I wake you?

176
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,076
You did.

177
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,120
Oh.

178
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,604
I just want to tell you
that I can't stop thinking about you.

179
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,874
Hmm.

180
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,585
And that I'm sorry that I acted stupid
and weird yesterday,

181
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,754
and that I just shouldn't have
pushed you away.

182
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,050
Judy, this is, uh...

183
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,931
Look, I think you need to maybe
take a beat,

184
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,641
sober on up,

185
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,936
and, uh, just think about
what you really want.

186
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,646
No, I know what I really want.

187
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,729
Do you?

188
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,565
I like you, Michelle.

189
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,943
Like, I <i>like you</i> like you.

190
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,655
Like, I wanted to come with a boom box
over my head like in <i>Say Anything,</i>

191
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,907
but I know that that's played out, so...

192
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,785
Yeah, it's totally played out,
but I would have liked it.

193
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,328
Shit! I can come back.

194
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,247
No, I get the sentiment.

195
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,750
I just think you are so smart

196
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,503
and funny and beautiful and sexy and...

197
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,881
your food is amazing...

198
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,135
and your eyes are delicious,

199
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,722
and I just really want to kiss you
right now if you'll let me.

200
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,822
Is your roommate home?

201
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,533
- She's on the night shift.
<i>- </i>Oh, great.

202
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,919
- Hi.
- Hi.

203
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,131
Um, these are for you.

204
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,883
Oh, thank you. Um...

205
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,287
- You really didn't have to...
- Oh, they're from my mom...

206
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,014
um, to say thank you for the vigil.

207
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,932
She's very grateful, and me, too. I'm...

208
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,184
very grateful, and so is she.

209
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,978
Well, it's the least I could do.

210
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,648
Oh, before I forget, your jacket.

211
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,527
- Um, here you go.
- Thanks.

212
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,611
Um...

213
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,700
I guess we should probably talk
about what happened last night.

214
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,287
Oh, no. What, um...
What... what did I do?

215
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,955
Did I say something stupid?

216
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,042
Oh, you don't remember?

217
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,544
I... I was really drunk.

218
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,713
It was kind of a blackout situation.

219
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,089
Uh...

220
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,259
Oh, no. Tell me I didn't do anything dumb.

221
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,181
No, no, you didn't.

222
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,727
It's just,
I saw that you were drinking and...

223
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,647
Yeah, yeah, um...

224
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,775
I mean, no judgment.
I just... was just concerned.

225
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,984
Thanks.

226
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,905
A week ago, I was a year sober.

227
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,864
Mm-hmm.

228
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,533
Woke up this morning,

229
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,536
and I had one of those mirror moments

230
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,332
where you just kind of want
to erase everything you see.

231
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,377
Don't relate to that at all.

232
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,756
Um, listen, actually,

233
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,884
I don't think
I can really help you anymore.

234
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,387
Just the rental market is dead, and...

235
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,222
How's the buyer's market?

236
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,516
Why?

237
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,435
Are you moving here permanently?

238
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,771
No, um, but...

239
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,566
it's looking like my parents have to sell,
because of Steve.

240
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,861
- Oh.
- It's a long story. I can't get into it,

241
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,489
- or I'll immediately start drinking again.
- Don't do that.

242
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,741
Um, but my mother was so taken with you,

243
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,203
that she wants you to be her realtor.

244
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,289
Oh, well, that's so nice.

245
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,667
But, um, yeah, I can't take that on.

246
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,919
Yeah, well, she wants someone
that she can trust,

247
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,255
and, you know, who she knows
is gonna look out for them.

248
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,552
Yeah, I know, it's just,
in my life right now...

249
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,511
I mean, the house has gotta be worth
at least 10 to 15 mil.

250
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,638
- Sorry to say "mil." That's icky.
- Yeah.

251
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,849
But if anyone should get that commission,

252
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,767
I mean, it's you.

253
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,065
I mean, I could take a look at it.

254
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,372
Hi, Hazel.

255
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,173
Flo?

256
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:51,187
Then in the early '80s,
we ripped up most of the marble floors

257
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,272
because it was slippery.

258
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,608
- Oh, so slippery. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Flashy.

259
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,109
Of course.

260
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,528
I didn't need my home to be a showcase.

261
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,156
I wanted it to be a safe space
for my children.

262
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,783
- Mm-hmm.
- It was, Mom.

263
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,118
No, it's a great place for kids.

264
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,328
Oh, thank you.

265
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,582
And thank you again
for what you did for us yesterday

266
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,709
with that beautiful vigil.

267
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,336
Oh, it was nothing.

268
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,087
It was everything.

269
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,965
You gave us hope,

270
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,135
just when things seemed the darkest.

271
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,597
When Steven gets home,

272
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,766
I'm going to make sure
he thanks you properly.

273
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,436
That's uh... Thank you.

274
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,441
- Benji, I'll let you finish the tour.
- Okay.

275
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,152
I need to rest my knees. I'm...

276
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,155
bone on bone. Hmm.

277
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,910
- Careful on the stairs, Mom.
- Mm-hmm. I'll take them one at a time.

278
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,497
- She'll take them one at a time.
- Hmm.

279
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,626
- Are you okay?
- Hmm?

280
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,044
Yeah, no, no, it's just...

281
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:58,963
Just a lot to take in.

282
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,048
Yeah. Subtle, right?

283
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,467
- Yeah.
- And the tour's just getting started.

284
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,844
Oh.

285
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,347
You know, you don't need to...
I can show myself around.

286
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,266
Oh, actually you can't.

287
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,851
People do get lost here.

288
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,563
I don't want to end up finding
your dusty skeleton in the maid's chamber

289
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,730
ten years from now.

290
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,983
I'm gonna pretend
you did not say "maid's chamber."

291
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,526
Me, too.

292
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,570
Uh, this is the sitting room,

293
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,614
where you can see my mother's love
of tassels on full display.

294
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,493
Oh, um, don't look at that.

295
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,121
Uh, that's not part of the tour.

296
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,080
Oh.

297
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,584
Yeah, that's eight-year-old me
wearing a turtleneck at the beach.

298
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,335
Hmm. What, were you cold?

299
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,546
No, quite the opposite.

300
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,715
It was a very hot summer.

301
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,301
No, it was because of the surgeries.

302
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,553
I had scars, and Steve didn't.

303
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,306
And I wanted all the girls to like me,
so I...

304
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,559
I thought, why advertise all that?

305
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,145
You know?
But they didn't like me anyway, so...

306
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,438
Come on, yeah, they did.

307
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,817
No. Believe it or not, hospital boy
whose best friend was a nurse

308
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,986
wasn't exactly bringing
all the girls to the yard.

309
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,154
Oh, fuck those girls.

310
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,156
They don't deserve you.

311
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,741
'Cause I...

312
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:15,039
I think that scars show that
you went through something hard,

313
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,123
and you survived.

314
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,460
And it's your story.

315
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,211
I like that.

316
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,048
Just how I look at it.

317
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,883
Yeah.

318
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,390
Is that an elephant made out of ivory?

319
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,601
- And we're walking.
- 'Cause that's fucked up.

320
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,603
Interesting.

321
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,740
Hi, I'm looking for a Flo Gutierrez.

322
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,119
I mean, I think her first name
is actually Flora.

323
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,079
Are you family?

324
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,623
- No, but I'm...
- ICU is family only. Sorry.

325
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,335
Right. Thanks.

326
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,235
Hey, Michelle.

327
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,445
- Judy. What are you doing here?
- Hey.

328
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,656
Hey. I came as soon as I heard.

329
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,782
Is she okay?

330
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,035
I don't know. She, um...

331
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,081
She had a stroke,
and they're, uh, doing some tests.

332
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,334
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Can I do anything?

333
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,503
No. Thank you. You don't...

334
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,164
You didn't even have to come.

335
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,214
Well, I know that, but...

336
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,216
Jesus Christ, it won't go away.

337
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,361
You're not allowed to be back here.

338
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,388
Ana, could you stop being a cop
for two seconds, please?

339
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,471
No.

340
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,975
Have you not heard a word I've said
about her?

341
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,059
Yes, I did.

342
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,103
She's a riptide,
whatever the fuck that means.

343
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,982
It's a metaphor,
but allow me to spell it out for you.

344
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,193
At best, she's an unstable accused stalker

345
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,696
who I have personally arrested
for destruction of property.

346
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,173
It wasn't a stalk, more of a follow,

347
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,425
and the property was that car...

348
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,285
At worst,
she's involved in an active investigation

349
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,164
where her ex-fiancé is currently missing
and possibly dead.

350
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,333
- What?
- Yeah.

351
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,545
So forgive me for being protective,

352
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,630
because I don't want you
to end up like him.

353
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Is that true?

354
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,595
I, um...

355
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,679
I mean...

356
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,725
Technically, he is missing.

357
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,352
But I, um...

358
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,271
You know what, I...

359
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,275
I can't deal with this right now.
There's...

360
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,359
This is too much.

361
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,153
I'm so sorry.

362
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,946
- I just want to be with my mom.
- Okay.

363
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,906
Alone.

364
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,075
- Oh... Michelle.
- Don't.

365
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,210
I'll just... go this way.

366
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:31,276
Listen, I know that you have been
making an effort to do the right thing

367
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,237
and to be a better person,

368
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,824
and I just want you to know that

369
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,491
I see you.

370
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,327
Okay.

371
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,995
I see you too.

372
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,456
No, like, the inner you.

373
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,292
Anyway, my work has been picking up,

374
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,711
and what I'm saying

375
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,589
is that if you keep
on the right path here,

376
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,593
there may be a car in your future.

377
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,762
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. Yep.

378
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,390
Good behavior pays off, bud.

379
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,729
- What the fuck?
- Hmm?

380
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,800
All right, go inside.

381
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,344
See if we have any paint.

382
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,811
Karen!

383
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,316
- Jeff.
- Jen.

384
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,734
- Jeff.
- Jen.

385
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,237
- Uh, yeah, I'm looking for Karen.
- I'm doing great.

386
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,448
- How are you?
- Okay.

387
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,366
Wait, is that not what you just asked?

388
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,428
No, not at all. Anyway, I was wondering...

389
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,579
We're getting divorced, Karen and I,
so it's, like...

390
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,290
- Oh, wow. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

391
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,210
Well, with the few details that I know,

392
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,753
it kind of makes sense.

393
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,898
- Anyway, I was wondering...
- Thank you, I appreciate it.

394
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,174
But, you know, like,
it's for the best, right?

395
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,257
No doubt.

396
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,636
Obviously I feel terrible
about lying to Karen.

397
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,222
- She did not deserve that.
- Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

398
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,475
It's not a lie to say
that I have had love for her.

399
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,019
It's just different with Sebastian.

400
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,270
It seems like it would be.

401
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,523
Love came knocking on my door,
and I had to answer.

402
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,777
I mean, that happens, what, once,
maybe twice in a lifetime, right?

403
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,321
- Yeah.
- In any case, thank you

404
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,366
for not telling Karen
before I got a chance to.

405
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,326
- I owe you one.
- Oh, I have the one.

406
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,204
- Um, we were just vandalized.
- Oh.

407
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,165
And I was wondering if I could look
at your street camera footage

408
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,334
from the last hour just
to see if it caught anything.

409
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,417
- Sure.
- Please.

410
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,419
It's...

411
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,630
Don't look at that.

412
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,713
Oh, Jesus.

413
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,008
Yeah, I don't make a habit of it.

414
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,303
- No?
- The last hour. Here you go.

415
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,724
People have, on the bright side,
been relatively supportive.

416
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,934
Not Karen, obviously.

417
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,412
I think this is something that's gonna
stick with her for a while.

418
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,480
I think she's gonna remember it,

419
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,066
but at least to my face, my parents...

420
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,192
I need another favor.

421
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,027
- Sure.
- Could you please delete

422
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,737
- that from the cloud?
- Sure.

423
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,156
And basically anything
from the last month or so?

424
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,786
Why? Are you also fucking Sebastian?

425
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,209
Seriously, I need you to delete it.

426
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,377
- Will do.
- Mm-hmm.

427
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,004
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

428
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,133
- I'm gonna be okay.
- Great.

429
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,843
It is great.

430
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,693
Oh!

431
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,705
Hi.

432
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,873
Hi.

433
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,528
Your baby's beautiful.

434
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,947
Oh, thanks, she's not mine.

435
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,115
I'm just a cuddler.

436
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,200
You're a what?

437
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,867
A cuddler.

438
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,205
We volunteer to hold the babies
when the parents aren't around.

439
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,500
Oh, I didn't even know that was a thing.

440
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:57,958
Yeah.

441
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,879
I feel like I get more out of it
than the babies do.

442
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,857
You hold them for two seconds,

443
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,484
and you forget there's anything bad
in the world.

444
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,508
Yeah, I bet.

445
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,636
Wow, what a dream job.

446
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,387
You should do it.

447
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,057
Wait. Seriously?

448
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,101
- How do you even...
- Oh, it's easy.

449
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,894
You just sit for an interview...

450
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,646
- Okay.
- ...get a little training,

451
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,271
and then you're in.

452
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,190
Okay.

453
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,151
After they do a background check.

454
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,370
Just gotta weed out any criminals.

455
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,404
Yeah.

456
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,784
So, maybe I'll see you around.

457
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:31,868
Yeah, maybe.

458
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,837
Hi.

459
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,059
Oh, hey.

460
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,603
You want to explain to me
why Parker felt the need

461
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,148
to write "I know what you did"
on our fucking garage door?

462
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,399
- Huh?
- Oh, shit.

463
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,650
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

464
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,985
- Charlie.
- I...

465
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,569
I just...

466
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,572
started hanging out with somebody else.

467
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,991
- You cheated on her?
- No...

468
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,118
Parker and I were never serious.

469
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,327
We were just hanging out.

470
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,330
You know what? She thought it was
serious enough to vandalize our house.

471
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,916
- It's not my fault she's crazy.
- Okay...

472
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,501
She's not crazy.

473
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,838
You treated her like shit,
so she was driven crazy.

474
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,382
- Okay...
- I mean, come on.

475
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,134
Just imagine how you would feel

476
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,304
if you loved someone and you found out
that they were fucking around on you.

477
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,596
You know what?

478
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,348
You would feel worthless.

479
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,105
And you would always wonder
why you weren't good enough.

480
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,275
So don't be that guy, Charlie.

481
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,319
I'm not. I'm not.

482
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,323
I just realized
I don't really like Parker.

483
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,406
Hmm.

484
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,495
And Natalie's different. She's chill.

485
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,038
Okay, she's chill? I don't...

486
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,457
Well, she doesn't care about
Instagram followers, or...

487
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,540
Okay.

488
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,836
Look...

489
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,255
And she lost her dad, too.

490
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,341
So...

491
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,135
we have stuff in common, I guess.

492
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,435
All right. Just...

493
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,355
Just be good to her.

494
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,148
Okay? Be kind.

495
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,943
Apologize to Parker.

496
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,237
Please.

497
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,739
You need to clean up your messes.

498
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,116
Starting with the garage door.

499
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,120
- Yeah?
- That was a demand, not a suggestion.

500
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,122
- Oh, right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

501
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,541
- Okay.
- Thank you.

502
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,350
Is Flo all right?

503
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,021
Look, I'm leaving.

504
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,856
I just want to know if she's okay.

505
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,153
She's on life support.

506
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,655
Doesn't look good.

507
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,035
Are you okay?

508
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,663
No.

509
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,750
But I will be.

510
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,050
Michelle is really lucky to have you.

511
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,097
They're my family.

512
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,520
Flo's the closest thing to a mother
I've had in a really long time.

513
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,857
I understand.

514
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,737
I lost my mom a while ago.

515
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,327
Can I give you a hug?

516
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,410
- No.
- Okay.
