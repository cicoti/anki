1
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,155
You wanna tell us
where you went last night?

2
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,282
- You're not in trouble.
- You're in so much fucking trouble.

3
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,100
I just drove without a license. Who cares?

4
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,560
The law. That's who cares.

5
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,203
Do you know what the punishment is
for driving without a license?

6
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,480
What?

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,125
- You go to fucking jail.
- A ticket, then...

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,316
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,211
You could get your mom
in a lot of trouble, too.

10
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,486
Yeah. So...

11
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,282
Do you want to tell me where you went
on your little joyride?

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,170
We didn't really go anywhere.

13
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,120
I picked up Parker around four, then
we drove out to where you found us.

14
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,872
We... we barely got out of the car.

15
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,957
- Oh, really? You barely got out?
- Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,960
What were you doing sitting
in a car for five hours?

17
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,090
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

18
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,255
- Oh.
- Give me your phone.

19
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,718
- What?
- You heard me.

20
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,179
And go get your laptop
and all your video game shit

21
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,262
and a power drill.

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,848
Why?

23
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,558
Because you just lost your bedroom door.

24
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,684
That...

25
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,287
- That's fucking crazy.
- You know what?

26
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,272
Until you can prove to me
that you can make good decisions

27
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,357
and that you care about anybody
but yourself,

28
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,692
you are gonna go where I go,

29
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,152
you are gonna do what I do.

30
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,905
No privileges and no fucking fun.

31
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,668
Judy, will you tell her
she's being insane?

32
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,241
I think Jen is your mother,

33
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,095
and you should listen to her
and trust that she knows what she's doing.

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,704
- Thank you, Judy.
- You're welcome.

35
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,808
You sure you know what you're doing?
I feel like you're being a little harsh.

36
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,952
Do you really think burning the car
was the best idea?

37
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,688
Charlie's fingerprints were all over it.
What choice did I have?

38
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,881
Don't you think it's like
sending a smoke signal?

39
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,818
Oh, my God. If I have to explain it,
then you're not gonna fucking get it.

40
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,927
- Mommy.
- Hi.

41
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,471
My stomach hurts.

42
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,224
I don't think I can go
to Holy Harmonies practice.

43
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,559
- Aww.
- But, babe, it's your first solo tonight.

44
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,770
Oh, maybe he's a little nervous?

45
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,316
Okay, look. Hen, we all have stuff
that we don't want to do,

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,079
but sometimes in life there are have-to's,

47
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,654
and you made a commitment,
so this is a have-to.

48
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,364
Here, for your tummy.

49
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,407
Thanks.

50
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,659
Is that a new necklace?

51
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,743
It's pretty.

52
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,372
Yeah. My new friend gave me the stone,
and then I made the necklace.

53
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,455
Cool.

54
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,667
New friend? What new friend?

55
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,252
Michelle. I met her at work.

56
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,335
Oh.

57
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,005
- Happy?
- Fucking ecstatic.

58
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,218
Oh, God.

59
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,184
- Motherfuck...
- Oh, sh...

60
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,028
Oh. Hey, Mrs. Harding.

61
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,446
Hi, Parker.

62
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,575
Look, I just wanted
to say I'm really sorry.

63
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,286
I think that we got off
on the wrong foot last night.

64
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,080
Yeah. You were, like, freaking out.

65
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,331
Yeah, that was nothing.

66
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,292
Uh,
that's why I brought you some cupcakes.

67
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:52,213
Aww, thanks, um, but I don't eat, like,
cupcake dough.

68
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,800
Sure. Uh, actually, you know what?

69
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,178
You posted a picture of Charlie.

70
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,095
Oh, yeah.

71
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,889
He looks like a total snack, right?

72
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,431
Right.

73
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,891
Here's the thing.

74
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,936
Charlie doesn't have a driver's license.

75
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,608
So if anyone saw that picture,
he would get in a lot of trouble.

76
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,443
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,529
So I'm gonna need you to, like,
take it down.

78
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,071
Oh.

79
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,118
Tsk. Yeah, see,
I would, because I love Charlie,

80
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,328
but I can't.

81
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,747
Wait, why?

82
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,830
'Cause I get paid.

83
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,833
I'm a micro-influencer, so...

84
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,753
I have no idea
what the fuck you're talking about.

85
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:35,215
Well, Instagram has, like,
big influencers and small influencers.

86
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,842
This is so fucking embarrassing.

87
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,678
Your mom is just trying to protect you.
She loves you.

88
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,597
Yeah, well,
she's pretty shitty at showing it.

89
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,519
I lost my virginity in a car.

90
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,437
It was beautiful.

91
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,981
It was a '78 Corvette.

92
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,465
We're not having this conversation.

93
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,524
No? Okay.

94
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,696
Do you like her? Parker.

95
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,198
I don't know.

96
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,744
Whatever. How does anybody know
if they like anybody?

97
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,827
I don't know.

98
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,790
Feel like you...

99
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,417
just like to be around them.

100
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,881
You want to be with them all the time,
and they make you feel safe.

101
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,716
And you can be your...

102
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,386
best self and your...

103
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,597
- when you feel vulnerable...
- Okay, can we not talk anymore?

104
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,681
Yeah.

105
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,724
One more thing.

106
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,646
Please use condoms.
You don't want to get warts.

107
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,817
- Or...
- Yep.

108
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,278
...any other sores down there.

109
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,029
Okay.

110
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,782
'Cause if there's oozing,
you're gonna be pretty upset.

111
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,786
And so under 800,000 followers is,
like, a whole different pay scale.

112
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,039
Okay, so how much then
for you to take the picture down?

113
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,833
Like, 100 bucks?

114
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,044
That's not a lot of money anymore.

115
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,380
Oh, fuck you. Um...

116
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,381
Five hundred.

117
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,051
A thousand dollars.

118
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,095
And because you love Charlie,

119
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,764
you will never mention your little outing
to anyone ever.

120
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,599
Okay.

121
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,642
Okay.

122
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,269
Please hold these.

123
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,734
What's...

124
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,193
What are you drawing?

125
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,362
Seriously?

126
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:23,990
It's a check.

127
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,702
Okay. Uh...

128
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,619
Do you have Venmo?

129
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,038
Do I have what, what?

130
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,541
Oh, you also have to watch out
for chlamydia, gonorrhea,

131
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,835
syphilis, which made
Benjamin Franklin crazy.

132
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,896
I don't know if you know,
but that's what he died of.

133
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,755
Anyway...

134
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,881
Oh, thank God.

135
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,251
How'd that go?

136
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,429
Expensive,
but she is going to take it down.

137
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,265
Hey, Charlie,
your girlfriend's a little extortionist.

138
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,350
She's not my girlfriend.

139
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,559
She seems to think so.

140
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,186
She said she loved you.

141
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,480
- Oh, Charlie.
- Shit, really?

142
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,482
Char...

143
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,235
Charlie, you need to know that sex is
something different for girls at your age.

144
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,362
At any age.

145
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,281
There are feelings involved.

146
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,784
You just gotta be careful, okay?

147
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,286
I know. Judy told me about warts.

148
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,539
It was part of a larger conversation.

149
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,626
Is that a thing?
Do people even get warts anymore?

150
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,627
There's a vaccine.

151
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,879
- You should get the vaccine.
- It's so '70s.

152
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,382
- Oh, shit.
- What?

153
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,803
- Why are they calling you?
- I don't know.

154
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,971
- Shouldn't you answer?
- Do I have to?

155
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,932
Miss Hale, thank you for coming.

156
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,015
Of course.

157
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,266
Your hair looks amazing.

158
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,894
- Did you do something different?
- No.

159
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,772
We got some new information pertaining
to Steve Wood.

160
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,065
Oh, you do?

161
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,443
- We've gained access to his phone records.
- Oh!

162
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,213
We've been trying
to piece together a timeline,

163
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,280
and interestingly,
his last calls made were to you.

164
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,615
Were they?

165
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,094
He called you a total of nine times
the night he disappeared.

166
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,663
Oh, that's right.
He called, but I didn't get it.

167
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,165
I just let them go to voicemail.

168
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,000
Hmm. You still have those voicemails?

169
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,503
Hmm. I don't know, I mean, do I?

170
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,399
Miss Hale, we can do this the hard way:
I go to a judge, request a warrant,

171
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,384
but it doesn't look great,
or you could just play me the messages.

172
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,885
- Which do you prefer?
- Neither.

173
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,470
- Neither's not an option.
- Okay.

174
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,348
If there's any information
on those voicemails, I need to know.

175
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,142
- There isn't.
- Prove it.

176
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,404
Do you think that maybe there's somewhere
private that we could listen to them?

177
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,288
<i>What the fuck, Judy?</i>

178
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,933
<i>You have some fucking nerve,
you know that? You better call me.</i>

179
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,877
<i>You hear me? Call me, you fucking bitch!</i>

180
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,274
I really appreciate you taking the time
to do this today.

181
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,132
Yeah, well, of course.

182
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,134
But I mean, if you like it,
I would jump on it,

183
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,028
'cause it's not gonna be
on the market for long.

184
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,637
Oh, I'll bet. It's pretty shwanky.

185
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,055
Oh, yeah, it's shwanky.

186
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,189
I mean, yes,
it's more than you wanted to pay,

187
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,810
but it does have a rooftop terrace
with a fire pit,

188
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,271
and of course, the beach is your backyard.

189
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,566
I'm not much of a beach guy.
That's more Steve's deal.

190
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,319
Well, the curtains are remote control,
so you can just shut those

191
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,779
- and not even look out there.
- You know what?

192
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,323
Nothing matters. I'll take it.

193
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:11,908
- Really?
- Yes.

194
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,327
I just have to get out
of my parents' house.

195
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,704
I have to. The same thing
happens every night.

196
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,208
My mom asks, "When you think we're gonna
find Steve?" I'm like, "Soon, probably."

197
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,043
And then she asks me if I want ice cream.

198
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,562
That's 'cause that's what she wants.

199
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,588
And then I go get the ice cream.
I bring it back.

200
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,548
She cries 'cause I'm not Steve.

201
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,051
And then I eat the ice cream.

202
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,846
- Oh, yeah. That sounds unhealthy.
- Yeah. It is.

203
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,058
I put on 4 LBs. All in my butt.

204
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,145
Well, lots of stairs here,
so you can work that off.

205
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,356
Yeah. My parents are just spiraling,
you know,

206
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,733
and now they're starting
to talk about offering a reward.

207
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,693
A reward for what?

208
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,779
Charlie, not now.

209
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,741
Oh. For anyone that just might know
anything about where my brother could be.

210
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,824
You know, I just feel like...
Don't you feel like...

211
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,830
a reward is just really
a slippery slope, you know?

212
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,099
- Yeah.
- Because then it's like giving,

213
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,000
like, a megaphone to all the crazies

214
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,964
so they can just be like,
"Yeah, I've seen him."

215
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,837
- Yeah.
- You know, "Down at the mart."

216
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,298
- How much of a reward?
- Charlie, seriously!

217
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,220
Oh. Oh, I gotta get this.

218
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,305
- Oh, yeah, no problem.
- Um, excuse me.

219
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,523
<i>I know you see me calling, bitch.</i>

220
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,612
<i>Come on, Jude,
will you just call me, please?</i>

221
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,698
<i>I... I'm sorry. I love you.</i>

222
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,491
<i>Will you please, please call me back?</i>

223
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,826
<i>I just need to talk to you.</i>

224
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,201
<i>I need you.</i>

225
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,704
<i>Come on, Jude.</i>

226
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,664
<i>Will you call me back, baby, please?</i>

227
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,747
<i>I love you.</i>

228
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,542
<i>All right? Let's work this out.</i>

229
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,625
<i>I love you.</i>

230
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,340
<i>You're not gonna get away with this!</i>

231
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,925
<i>You're no fucking angel.</i>

232
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,511
<i>You can't hide forever,
and when I fucking find you,</i>

233
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,513
<i>I am going to fucking kill you!</i>

234
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,057
<i>You hear me? You are fucking dead!</i>

235
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,649
Oh, I take it he didn't find you.

236
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,529
No.

237
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,784
Are you at all concerned
about your safety, Miss Hale?

238
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,494
What?

239
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,497
Are you afraid he's gonna hurt you?

240
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,252
No.

241
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,722
Char.

242
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,767
Oh, there you are.

243
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,685
Hey.

244
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,149
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ,
now you're smoking?

245
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,486
- Better than vaping.
- God, what is wrong with you?

246
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,612
Everything, apparently.

247
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,281
- What, so now, like, nothing matters?
- Not really.

248
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,742
- Anything I do, you're gonna be mad at me.
- You know what?

249
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,787
I don't want to be mad at you,
okay, Charlie?

250
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,164
So help me out here
and do something fucking right.

251
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,833
It's just a stupid cigarette.
It's not like you never do it.

252
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,628
What? What are you talking about?

253
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,871
I've seen the pack you hide on the shelf
in the kitchen where the big bowls are.

254
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,801
Yeah, well, you know what?

255
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,637
I do what I want. I'm an adult.

256
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,806
So you just get to do
whatever the fuck you want?

257
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,059
Yeah, I do.

258
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,564
And when you're an adult,
you can, too, but for now,

259
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,066
you are a kid,

260
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,152
and I would try to hold onto that
for as long as you can, honey.

261
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,547
'Cause let me tell you something,
when you get to the other side,

262
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,282
you are gonna have to deal with
some pretty shitty stuff.

263
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,201
Like I haven't?

264
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,424
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

265
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,550
What happened?

266
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,386
<i>- It's okay. They haven't found the car.</i>
- Uh-huh.

267
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,514
<i>- But...</i>
- Uh, gotta go. I gotta go.

268
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,850
Hey. Everything all right?

269
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,185
They, uh...

270
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,021
found remains.

271
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,774
What?

272
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,192
Where?

273
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,403
Um...

274
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,781
I don't know. My dad's friend called
from the station, and, uh...

275
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,160
I'm supposed to go down there
or something.

276
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,414
I... I don't know how to do this.

277
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,000
Do you have anyone
that can go with you or...

278
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,294
No. Um...

279
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,713
It's all right. I can go alone.

280
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,551
No, you shouldn't have to do that.

281
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,014
Okay.

282
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,002
Excuse me, ma'am,
you can't be doing that stuff here,

283
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,004
unless you're gonna share.

284
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,465
Sure.

285
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,550
But you have to step into my office.

286
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:37,316
Oh, fuck, yes! This song is the best.

287
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,278
Actually, no, never mind.
I have never heard this song in my life.

288
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,742
Wait, you're not up on
whatever kind of music this is?

289
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,826
Apparently not.

290
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,703
It's stuck on AM.

291
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,914
But it's very comforting.

292
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,250
- I could see that.
- Yeah.

293
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,546
I'm sorry I ran off last night.

294
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,089
Oh, no, don't...

295
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,464
No stress.

296
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,134
I'm just, uh, I'm sorry you had to go.

297
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,887
I was having a really good time.

298
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,472
Yeah, me too.

299
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,976
And then Jen had an emergency, so...

300
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,269
Is everything okay?

301
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,771
Um...

302
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,648
No...

303
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,734
Her son stole a car.

304
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,529
Oh, shit.

305
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,612
Yeah.

306
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,742
So you're <i>that </i>friend, huh?
You're the clutch friend?

307
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,536
Yes, but she is too.

308
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,621
She's, you know...

309
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:38,460
She's great. She took me in
when I was kinda in between places.

310
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,798
- So you guys, uh, live together?
- Mm-hmm.

311
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,844
And you're just friends?

312
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,387
Oh, just friends, yeah.

313
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,473
'Cause you're not, uh...

314
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,850
Not with her.

315
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,065
- Is this the moonstone I gave you?
- Yes, yes.

316
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,629
I thought it looked pretty like this.

317
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,443
It does.

318
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,030
It looks really pretty on you.

319
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,197
Thank you.

320
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,664
Should we, um...

321
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,082
maybe...

322
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,545
go get some tacos?

323
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,675
Yeah.

324
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,679
I am fucking starving.

325
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,923
It's not him.

326
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,759
It's not?

327
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,928
Mr. Wood, I know your family
has connections here,

328
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,721
but everyone needs to follow protocol.

329
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,845
Are you sure it's not him?

330
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,977
Forensics just determined
the remains belonged to a female.

331
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,180
Oh, that's great.

332
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,523
I mean, uh...
a great tragedy for her family.

333
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,817
Yeah. Uh...

334
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,944
- Thank you, Detective.
- Yes, thank you.

335
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,947
I'm sorry.
How do you two know each other?

336
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,074
Oh, I'm helping him find a rental.

337
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,743
- Yeah, Steve's ex introduced us.
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,119
Judy Hale?

339
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,872
- You know Judy?
- I do.

340
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,582
- It's a small town.
- No, it's not.

341
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,334
Ehhh.

342
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,839
Hi, may I have two salmon tacos,

343
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,507
uh, two chicken,

344
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,509
two tofu mushroom burgers?

345
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,468
That's too much.

346
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,179
Accept your destiny, please.

347
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,099
Um, one beef burrito, uh...

348
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,561
carnitas nachos, loaded,
and one large guac.

349
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,229
And two Mexican Cokes, please.

350
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,606
That was masterful.

351
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,608
No, no, I got it.

352
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,609
Thank you.

353
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,111
Here. Keep the change.

354
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,737
Thank you.

355
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,490
I love a Mexican Coke.

356
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,051
- Aren't they so much better?
- The best.

357
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,594
- They're real sugar.
- Yes, that's why.

358
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,378
I can't believe
you haven't been here before.

359
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,456
Best tacos in Laguna.

360
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,292
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just choked for a second.

361
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,375
- Hmm.
- This Coke.

362
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,253
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey.

363
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,464
My God, it's great to see you.

364
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,007
Is it?

365
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,342
Hi, I'm Michelle.

366
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,803
- What's up?
- Hi.

367
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,680
How are... how are you doing?

368
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,600
Well, I left my house today,

369
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,061
so that's a start.

370
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
How's...

371
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,482
How's Steve?

372
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,959
How's he?

373
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,485
He's, uh...

374
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,028
Who's Steve?

375
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,114
- Oh, that's her boyfriend.
- No. He's my ex-boyfriend.

376
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,535
- That didn't work out.
- Yeah. Guess I know how that goes.

377
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,040
- Hey, it was really nice to meet you.
- You too.

378
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,875
- Take care.
- Mm.

379
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,378
Drive safely.

380
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,844
- What the fuck was that?
- Yeah, right?

381
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,347
Weird.

382
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,910
- Order's up.
- Oh, that's us.

383
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,645
Well, that was a relief, huh?

384
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,188
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

385
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,235
Oh. Oh, God, Ben.

386
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,154
- Ben.
- I'm sorry.

387
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,240
It's okay. You don't have to apologize.

388
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,117
I just thought, you know...

389
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,495
I thought for sure it was gonna be Steve.

390
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,456
Well, it wasn't him.

391
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,334
No, I know, but for a minute there,
I thought it was...

392
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,878
I thought it was gonna be him.

393
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,673
Ooh, God, I feel sick.

394
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,968
- Oh, this is a terrible feeling.
- Mm-hmm.

395
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,514
I don't know how people live
with that feeling.

396
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,309
Well, you don't have a choice.

397
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,937
You just learn to cope.

398
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,274
Yeah.

399
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,403
Thank you for coming with me.

400
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,756
I know this is not how you wanted
to spend your afternoon,

401
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,657
- at a police station.
- Oh, it's okay.

402
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,410
You're a very kind realtor.

403
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,536
Can I, um...

404
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,705
pay you back with a mocktail?

405
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,790
Oh, uh, I... I can't.

406
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,459
Yours doesn't have to be a mock,
it can be a cock...

407
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,543
Cocktail.

408
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,548
No, I got it.
Uh, no, actually, I have to go.

409
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,134
My son is singing his first solo
with his...

410
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,303
Always so hard to say.

411
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,388
...his Christian rock choral group.

412
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,182
Wait.

413
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,727
Are you talking about the Holy Harmonies?

414
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,104
Why do you know that?

415
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,110
Holy Harmonizer, '86 through '89.

416
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,571
- Really?
- Yes.

417
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,239
Actually, I'm not surprised by that.

418
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,451
Wow, that's great!
Oh, I'd love to see that.

419
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,788
I mean, not that, you know,
I'm self-inviting or anything.

420
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,790
You are, though, aren't you?

421
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,043
- I mean, it's been a while.
- Okay.

422
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,545
- The more the merrier.
- And...

423
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,172
- Really?
- Sure.

424
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,967
Oh, fantastic news.

425
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,719
- My cup of tizzle.
- Mm-hmm.

426
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,348
Well, we only dated for a little bit.

427
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,268
He's actually really sweet.
Just didn't end so great.

428
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,062
Yeah, that was obvious.

429
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,023
I feel like I'm gonna need the story.

430
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,026
The story doesn't really paint me
in the greatest light.

431
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,945
Well, now I want to hear more.

432
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,535
I thought I was pregnant
with someone else's baby.

433
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,829
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

434
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,457
But I wasn't.

435
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,542
It turns out that, um...

436
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,421
I can't have kids, actually.

437
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,090
I'm sorry.

438
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,967
Thanks.

439
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,262
Is that something you really wanted?

440
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,345
Yeah.

441
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,931
Yeah, very much.

442
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,641
Yeah, me too.

443
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,811
I always wanted to adopt, but...

444
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,063
my ex didn't want kids.

445
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,565
Maybe the next person will.

446
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,901
Yeah, maybe.

447
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,618
I still live with her, which is a thing.

448
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,121
Your ex?

449
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,204
Yeah.

450
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,082
I mean, we broke up a while ago,

451
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,208
uh, but...

452
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,628
I couldn't just cut and run.
I mean, she...

453
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,717
she grew up in foster care,
and she has... abandonment stuff.

454
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,762
We're more like family than anything else
at this point, but...

455
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,230
I don't know,
I hope that doesn't sound weird.

456
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,435
I think it sounds really sweet.

457
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,792
- Would you wanna...
- You wanna go see a kids' Christian choir?

458
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,194
Wow, well, I was gonna say
go see a movie,

459
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,363
but what you just said is weirder.

460
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,657
So... yeah.

461
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,785

00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,603
I mean, but it is cute.

480
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,522
Oh, wait till you see Henry.

481
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,691
Hey.

482
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,238

- What's going on, huh?
<i>- </i>Henry's having some show night jitters.

485
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,700
Oh, I'm sure he's just nervous
'cause he has a solo.

486
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,807
I think he's still upset
about what my dog did to his bird,

487
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,600
but we're sending Adele to boot camp
as we speak.

488
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,102
- Why?
- I don't know how to discipline.

489
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,766
I've only ever had two rules in my house:

490
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,879
smoke out the windows
and don't bring Prosecco.

491
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,589
Adele didn't kill the bird.

492
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,466
- What?
- Shandy did it.

493
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,928
Which, looking back,
seems like it was right there.

494
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,973
- I thought I told you.
- No, you did not. Jen!

495
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,641
Adele is halfway to Oxnard.

496
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:58,437
God. Well, maybe she'll pick up
some good habits or something.

497
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,106
Hey.

498
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,149
What's going on?

499
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,528
It's okay, tell her.

500
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:09,990
Tell me what, hon?

501
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,327
He doesn't want to do it.
It's too much for him, but...

502
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,538
he's scared that
you're gonna be mad, so...

503
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,876
Oh, Boop, I'm not mad.

504
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,254
I thought I had to.

505
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,131
- Um...
- Hmm?

506
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,968
Honestly, this is for the best.
He hasn't exactly found his falsetto.

507
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,012
Okay, look.

508
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,640
Let's forget the have-to's. Okay?

509
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,976
What do you want to do?

510
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:46,318
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

511
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,863
<i>♪ Fun times, it's what the world needs ♪</i>

512

513
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,201
- No, no, no!
- No, I'm good at this game!

514
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,417
Fuck, yeah!

515
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,062
- Look at you on your Harley!
- Wow!

516
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,636
Oh.

517
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:16,973
Well, it is very nice to meet you,
new friend Michelle.

518
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,060
Likewise.
Judy speaks very, very highly of you.

519
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:23,063
'Cause I know all of her secrets.

520
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,484
Can I get anybody a drink
so that I can begin to drink?

521
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,153
Yes, please. Thank you.
Um, I'll take a Chardonnay.

522
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,738
- Yeah, me, too. Please.
- Great.

523
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,657
I will get two bottles, just to be safe.

524
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,950
Oh, yes. Thank you.

525
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,329
You like her.

526
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,746
I do.

527
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,083
She makes me feel really good.

528
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,837
- You deserve that.
- Thanks.

529
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,172
She seems great.

530
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,049
She's got a very nice energy.

531
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,386
What, did you just comment
on someone's energy?

532
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,303
Nope.

533
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,864
- I'm pretty sure I heard that.
- Nope.

534
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,348
- "Nice energy."
- Don't get excited.

535
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,059
- Uh-huh.
- Didn't happen.

536
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:02,686
It did.

537
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,355
She's getting me booze,
and she suggested two bottles.

538
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,918
- She's really funny...
- So what is she gonna get for herself?

539
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,819
All right.

540
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,904
Go, go, go, go!

541
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,407
Oh, we got a tight one.
This is a nail biter.

542
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,490
I know. Yes!

543
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,995
Whoo! Hey, third!

544
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,078
Look who won.

545
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,874
Nicely done.
Nice. How's your pinball game?

546
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,126
I'm pretty good at pinball.

547
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,253
Yeah? Strong? All right. Let's find one.

548
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,342
- Hey. What? What's up?
- Hey.

549
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,140
I'm gonna put your door back on.

550
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,309
Just don't have sex in there.

551
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:46,855
Or do. I... It's better than a car,
I don't know. Just...

552
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,774
Just protect yourself.

553
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,152
Always get consent.

554
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,697
- Yep.
- Okay?

555
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,489
Okay.

556
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,611
Oh, yeah. All right, okay..

557
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,406
- Are you letting me win?
- Uh, maybe...

558
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:43,702
What?

559
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,039
Oh, um...

560
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,000
I just remembered I should
write you a check for that rental.

561
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,684
Oh, I'm not letting you take that place.

562
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,048
No, you shouldn't be paying oceanfront
prices when you hate the beach.

563
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,132
Just...

564
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,386
You wanna like what you're looking at.

565
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,347
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you do.
