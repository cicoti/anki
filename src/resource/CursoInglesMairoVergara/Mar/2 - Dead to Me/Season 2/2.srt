1
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,266
Hi, Ben.

2
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,349
Hey.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,270
Who the fuck is Ben?

4
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,814
Um... I'm the fuck is Ben.

5
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:23,732
What?

6
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,316
Jen, this is Steve's brother.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,360
What the fuck, Steve has a twin brother?

8
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,695
- He does.
- He do.

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,656
Steve has an identical twin brother?

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,384
- They're not identical.
- We're not actually identical.

11
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,719
- We're semi-identical.
- Semi-identical.

12
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:35,869
Oh, you're semi-identical.

13
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,620
Yeah, so two sperm, one egg.

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,081
Like a double yolk,
only the sperm is the yolk.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,041
Does that make sense?

16
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,545
Am I dead? Did I die?

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,841
I don't think so.
I mean, unless we're all dead.

18
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:53,136
Nobody's dead. No. We're not.

19
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,595
Nobody's dead.

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,889
Okay.

21
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,434
- Are you all right?
- Mm-hmm.

22
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:08,026
Hey, hey. You okay?

23
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,778
Yeah, I'm fine.

24
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,654
You don't seem fine. You fainted.

25
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,281
And you look a little upset.

26
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,701
That's just my face. I have an upset face.

27
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,079
No, it's a fine face. It's a good face.

28
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,498
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,666
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,086
The fainting could be
a blood pressure thing.

31
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,879
Yeah. Ben's a doctor.

32
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,006
Chiropractor.
And I'm gonna beat you to the punch.

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,258
We are actual doctors,
and we got your back.

34
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,596
Um, have you been under any stress lately?

35
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,432
- Um...
- No, why would I be...

36
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,934
- Nah.
- Like, just the minimal...

37
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,787
- Maybe a smidge.
- ...stuff like political landscape...

38
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,571
- Weight of the world...
- ...global warming.

39
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,022
- Everybody's feeling it.
- Um...

40
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,524
- But no.
- Little bit.

41
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,025
- All good.
- Yeah.

42
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,484
Coolio.

43
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,447
Can I just back up here?
Why are you here?

44
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,785
Oh, right. I'm sorry,
I just barged in, didn't I? Um...

45
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:02,247
Judy, I tried you.
Steve's missing, and so is his car,

46
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,998
and he usually calls our mom every night,

47
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,626
and she hasn't heard from him
in a few days. Nobody has.

48
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,461
- That's so weird.
- It's so weird.

49
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,482
- He calls his mom every day?
- Yeah, they're very close.

50
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,007
Yeah, he's her favorite.

51
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,301
Someone's got to be the black sheep.
Baa baa!

52
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,304
So, Judy, uh...

53
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,098
I don't wanna freak you out,

54
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,643
but the FBI came by the house today
looking for Steve.

55
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,018
Have you seen him?

56
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,272
Uh...

57
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,731
What did you do?

58
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,025
What do we do?

59
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,403
No.

60
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,947
- Nope.
- Haven't seen him.

61
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,450
I'm sorry, the... the FBI

62
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,369
is looking for Steve?

63
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,997
Like, the American...

64
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,791
FBI?

65
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,293
Yeah, that FBI.

66
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,670
- Why?
- I have no idea.

67
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,381
I mean, honestly, he's been
in trouble before, but not like this.

68
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,360
You know, this isn't him getting
into a fist fight at a Sugar Ray concert.

69
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,720
Well, to be fair,
the guy was there ironically.

70
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,929
That's just so douchey.

71
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,764
- What?
- Sugar Ray's so fucking douchey.

72
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,868
- They have a couple good songs.
- They don't. Name one.

73
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,101
He's a journalist now.

74
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,353
Mom.

75
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,688
Honey. Hi, babe.

76
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,523
Can you just get your bowl,
get your cereal,

77
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,002
let's, you know what I mean,
start the process of the morning?

78
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,653
Okay. Uh, hi.

79
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,377
- Hey, bud.
- Well, this is my friend Ben.

80
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,032
I didn't know you had other friends.

81
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,117
- Oh.
- Sweetheart.

82
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,345
I'm worried.
Dad didn't come to my window this morning.

83
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,015
He didn't? I'm sure it's fine.
I'm sure he's just busy being a bird.

84
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,082
What the frig?

85
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,000
- What?
- Okay.

86
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,878
My dad just texted
saying they raided Steve's office.

87
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,004
What?

88
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,546
I got to go.

89
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,467
Um, he's wigging out. I have to go.

90
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,051
Thank you.

91
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,344
Bye.

92
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,515
Wait, the FBI is looking for Steve?
The fucking FBI.

93
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,725
Why?

94
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,978
- I think that might be on me, actually.
- Huh? What are you talking about?

95
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,774
I turned Steve in for money laundering
last week.

96
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,109
You what? You did what?

97
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,070
- I know. It's a lot to process.
- Oh, my God.

98
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,780
How can you be just telling me this now?

99
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,866
Oh, and he has a fucking identical twin?

100
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,911
You didn't feel like you should have
mentioned that before?

101
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,639
- Well, they're semi-identical.
- Oh, stop!

102
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,456
They're the fucking same person!

103
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,667
Okay. There was a lot going on, all right?

104
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,686
You and I weren't exactly talking
when I turned Steve in.

105
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,922
Then you did what you had
to do. I had to help you hide the body.

106
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,900
- What are you doing? I liked that one.
- Shut up!

107
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,758
Okay.

108
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,635
Do you even know how fucked I am?

109
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,137
I mean, if it wasn't bad before, it's...

110
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,430
The FBI?

111
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,225
I mean, they're good
at connecting dots, Judy,

112
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,520
- and we are the fucking dots.
- No, we are not the dots.

113
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,313
Steve's business is the dots.

114
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,637
That's all the FBI cares about.

115
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,043
They're actually really nice.
I've been cooperating with them.

116
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,485
What? You... I'm sorry...

117
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,863
Oh, my God.

118
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,575
Steve was right.

119
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,496
Wherever you go, fucking chaos follows.

120
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,789
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,294
I'm so sorry. Please.
I didn't mean to drag you into this mess.

122
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,587
- I'm sorry.
- Can you please just stop saying sorry?

123
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,799
You say sorry so much,
it doesn't mean anything anymore.

124
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,593
It's just like this fucking sound
that comes out of your mouth.

125
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,678
Okay, sorry.

126
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,347
What's gonna happen to my boys, Judy?

127
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,226
If I get caught...

128
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,550
...what's gonna happen to them?

129
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,521
They're gonna be orphans.

130
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,148
- No.
- Yes.

131
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,317
They'll be all alone, Judy.

132
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,320
No, I won't let that happen.
I will be there for them.

133
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,489
You? Oh, God.

134
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,575
You think I'm gonna leave my kids to you?

135
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,286
You were just sleeping
in a car ten hours ago.

136
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,331
You might have the worst judgment
of anyone that I have ever met.

137
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,834
I can help us out of this.

138
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,004
I can go to the FBI
and steer 'em in a different direction.

139
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,087
No.

140
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:43,009
You do not talk to the FBI.

141
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,261
You don't steer anything.

142
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,472
Just stay the fuck out of it.

143
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,850
<i>Mexico?</i>

144
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,561
Yeah. I was thinking about it,
and I remembered

145
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,314
that Steve always said that
if he ever got in real trouble,

146
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,877
that he would just go down to Mexico,

147
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,651
get a new identity and, like,
go away forever.

148
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,445
- A new identity?
- Yeah, right?

149
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,823
There's somewhere your family used
to vacation. He always talked about it.

150
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,617
I mean, we used to go to Rosarito.

151
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,700
Rosarito!

152
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,162
Hey, girl.

153
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,121
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey.

154
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,956
- Hey, girl.
- No word from Steve, huh?

155
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,875
No. Weird, right, girl?

156
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,834
Super weird.

157
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,505
What is going on?
Because the FBI guys were really rude.

158
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,649
They took all of the computers
and didn't even want water.

159
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,716
Girl, that is rude.

160
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,218
- Right, girl?
- Girl.

161
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,641
Oh, my God.

162
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,269
Steve, what did you do?

163
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,252
I don't care
if the condo is carpeted, Janice.

164
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,837
Just sell it.

165
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,842
Look who made the cover
of <i>Over Asking, </i>Jennifer.

166
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,925
Wow, look at you.

167
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,929
Do you know how long I've worked
for this moment?

168
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,743
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were gonna
go through...

169
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,287
- Thirty-six years.
- Thirty-six years.

170
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,523
Um, well, that's quite the feather
in your cap.

171
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,525
Am I picking up on a little jealousy?

172
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,653
That's not what I'm putting down.
Oh, I was drinking that.

173
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,239
Well, congratulations.

174
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,657
It is well-deserved.

175
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,742
As my Aunt Trista used to say,

176
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,245
"Success and passion are two sides
of the same coin.

177
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,164
Use the coin, and dreams fly.

178
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,874
Lose the coin, and..."

179
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,545
Oh, can't remember.
But it's all in the article.

180
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,674
Oh, great. I really can't wait to dig in.

181
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,803
Lorna, I need to ask you something.
It's...

182
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,764
- It's, uh, it's about the boys.
- Oh.

183
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,933
- I'm all ears.
- Okay.

184
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,393
Okay, um...

185
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,315
In the event that something may happen
to me,

186
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,526
I was wondering if, um...

187
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,031
if you would be the boys' legal guardian.

188
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,451
How long do you have?

189
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,453
What? No, I'm not sick.

190
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,306
You don't have to be brave with me,
you're family.

191
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,330
No, really.

192
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,124
No, I'm just...

193
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,959
I'm redoing my will.

194
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,629
Just thought, since Ted, that I...

195
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,255
I should update some stuff.

196
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,800
Of course. That's wise.

197
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,884
Yeah.

198
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,974
Raising Ted was the great honor
of my life.

199
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,562
It would be my privilege
to raise those boys.

200
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,646
Okay.

201
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,775
- Still, I'd get some blood work done.
- Hmm?

202
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,138
You're looking a little brittle.

203
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,695
- Thank you.
- How's your sleep?

204
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,657
Well, it could be better.

205
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,408
Hmm. Well.

206
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,372
It says to take one, but you can take two.

207
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,123
- You'll sleep like a baby.
- Okay.

208
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,835
- This is fentanyl, Lorna.
- Huh?

209
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,504
How did you even get this?

210
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,049
I truly can't remember.

211
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,761
Well, must be good shit, then.

212
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,639
Friggin' Steve.

213
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,599
Didn't make enough money as a lawyer,

214
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,227
he had to steal,
or whatever the heck money laundering is.

215
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,895
Yeah, I'm not really sure.

216
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,692
I mean, I do know that it has something
to do with his art gallery.

217
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,484
What?

218
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,321
He told us he opened that
to sell your paintings.

219
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,574
Yeah, that's what he told me, too, but...

220
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,909
it's really just a front.

221
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,370
I'll probably never see
those paintings again.

222
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,081
Can I just say that...

223
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,751
...I'm glad you guys broke up.

224
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,797
I mean, it would've been great
to have you in the family,

225
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,924
but he doesn't deserve you.

226
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,552
You're much better off without him.

227
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,641
Oh, Judy. I know.

228
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,478
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be a jerk.

229
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,063
Oh, God.

230
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,066
You know I love him.

231
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,069
- Yeah.
- I know you do, too.

232
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,070
Yeah.

233
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,036
Oh, Ben, I have to tell you something.

234
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,412
Okay.

235
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,420
I'm the one that turned Steve in
to the police.

236
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,174
W... What? Why?

237
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,677
I don't know. I mean, at the time,
it seemed like a really good idea,

238
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,387
but I regret it now.

239
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,888
I really do.

240
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,392
Um...

241
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,313
Wow.

242
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,939
I'm so sorry.

243
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,441
I'm so sorry.

244
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,154
No, you did the right thing.

245
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,866
He brought this on himself.

246
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,952
You don't feel bad for one second.

247
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,259
He's always been so good at everything.

248
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,096
Except for doing the right thing.

249
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,391
Which, ironically,
is usually the easiest thing to do.

250
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,775
Do you mind if I keep this?

251
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:35,985
What is it?

252
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,949
It's from a trip that Steve and I took
to the Petrified Forest.

253
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,911
When I got pregnant for the first time.

254
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,748
Hey, Jude, I...

255
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,169
I'm so sorry that didn't work out for you.

256
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,547
I really hope you get
another chance at that.

257
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,632
Thanks.

258
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,137
Wait, the Petrified Forest?

259
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,682
I thought you weren't supposed
to take rocks from there.

260
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,227
Yeah, there are multiple signs.

261
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,898

- Oh, hi.
- We're looking for one more Harmommy

267
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,737
to run the beach cleanup next Friday.
Can I sign you up?

268
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
I'm busy Friday.

Okay, well, just looking ahead, you know,

270
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,910
we need volunteers
for the Easter Lamb Jam,

271
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,244
which is a tentative title.

00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,414
Tia is pushing it, but I'm like,
does it work too well?

273
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,832
Hmm. It doesn't.

274
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:16,587
Uh, Easter's a little far off, and...

275
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,422
Yeah, I don't know if I'll be around.

276
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:24,094
I know you have a lot on your plate
being a single mom now,

00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,364
but we need to get our ducks in a row...

278
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,474
Okay, I said I don't fucking know
if I'll be able to.

279
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,142
Okay.

280
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,771

Hi.

285
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,335
Hey, I wanted to ask you,
is your brother Sean still a lawyer?

286
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,005
Why? Don't tell me, the cops are finally
suing you for harassment?

287

No. No, I'm redoing my will.

he's a criminal defense attorney.

Hey, are you okay?
You seem vulnerable.

292
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,690
It's a strange color on you.

293
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,984

00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,486

00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,827
Well, hello.

298
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,413
- This is Adele.
- Mm-hmm.

299
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,206
Alan and I just got her.

300
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,250
How shmooshy is she?

301
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,626
She's so shmooshy.

302
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,546
- Yeah.
- You and Alan got a dog together, huh?

303
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,631
- You've been dating a month.
- I know.

304
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,633
We're a lesbian stereotype,

Hold her.

00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,935
- Trust me.
- No, it's okay.

309
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,413
- I'm okay.

310
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,147
Oh. Why are you talking like that?

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,399

I'll give you the number of her breeder.

00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,017
You bought a puppy from a fucking breeder?

318

No.

319
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,427
Hey, you know, guys, I was thinking,

320
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,348
you know, we haven't taken
a family vacation in a really long time,

321
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,183
and wouldn't that be fun?

322
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,018
You know, maybe go somewhere, like,

323
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,520
- far away?
- How far?

324
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:44,193
Oh, I don't know, honey,

00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,737
Canada's lame.
It's like the PBS of countries.

326
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,073
No, no. Canada's cool now.

00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,960
Can I practice parallel parking?

332
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,087
No.

333
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,602
Detective Perez. Hi.

334
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,729
- Are you here about my dad?
- Charlie.

335
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,647
You find his killer?

I need to talk to your mom alone.

337
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,193
- Go inside.
- Say what?

338
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,116
It's okay, honey, it's okay.
Everything's fine.

339
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,298
Just go inside.
Sorry, just, ever since his dad...

340
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,783
No, it's okay, he's been through a lot.
It's tough on a kid.

342
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,040
I want to apologize.

343
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,709

but we're out of bay leaves. Hi.

00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,513
- You got to be kidding me.
- Okay, I can explain.

349
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,598
Nice to see you. Did you get highlights?

350
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,183
I did.

351
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,854
I know. I know
this just looks really weird, but, um...

352
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,190
- it was just all a big misunderstanding.
- Yeah.

353
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,360
It was a big misunderstanding about her
hitting your husband with her car?

354
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,963
And you were just in my office
a few days ago

355
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,488
yelling at me to have her arrested,

356
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,324
which if I had the physical evidence,
trust me, I would.

357
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,452
I don't think that I was yelling...

358
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,289
um... but I... I was wrong.

359
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,251
- It was Steve Wood's car.
- It was.

360
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,086
- He was driving.
- He was.

361
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,605
- Judy wasn't even there.
- No, I wasn't.

362
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,648
You told me she confessed.

363
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,923
- Well, I did, but...
- She did.

364
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,067
Are you changing your story?

365
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,845
- Well, I mean, she was taking the blame.
- I was.

366
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,305
- Go inside.
- Okay.

367
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,101
All right, you know what I want to do?

368
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,605
I just want to put this all behind me,
you know?

369
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:49,610
Forgive, forget. Just super solid.
You get it.

370
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,029
No, I'm so confused.

371
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,842
Unless this has something to do
with the half-million dollar check

372
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,700
that Miss Hale gave you,

373
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,144
which you can't cash
because all of his accounts are frozen.

374
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,288
Steve Wood made her do it.

375
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,332
Did he? Oh.

376
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,751
You know how people drown, Mrs. Harding?

377
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,462
I'm sorry?

378
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,714
They get into water that
they think they can handle.

379
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,509
Then a riptide comes and pulls them
under, and then it's too late.

380
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,884
Oh.

381
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,013
Judy Hale is a riptide,

382
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,283
and Steve Wood is involved
with some very dangerous people,

383
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,392
so if I were you, I'd be very careful.

384
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,938
Fucking, fucking shit.
Fucking, fucking shit.

385
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,689
She's suspicious.

386
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,108
She got real, real coppy with me.

387
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,109
I mean, she is a cop.

388
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,236
No, I know,
but she brought up the fucking check.

389
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,363
I think she thinks
that you're trying to pay me off.

390
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,489
Pay you off?

391
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,783
Yes, to cover up the fact
that you killed my husband.

392
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,619
- Oh, that does make sense.
- Imagine what it looked like to her,

393
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,830
you coming out of the house babbling
about bay leaves.

394
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,674
- By the way, you do have one left.
- I don't fucking care about that!

395
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,584
Who are these dangerous people?

396
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,420
Okay, this might be good.

397
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,340
I think she's probably talking
about the Greeks.

398
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,883
Like, maybe she thinks that

399
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,386
they're responsible
for Steve disappearing.

400
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,763
I'm sorry, what... what... what Greeks?

401
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,223
Okay, it's complicated,

402
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,016
and I'm not sure
who all the players are...

403
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,893
Just fucking spit it out, please!

404
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,605
Steve was peripherally involved

405
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,275
with the Greek Mafia. Peripherally.

406
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,571
I'm sorry, that's who he was
laundering money for?

407
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,323
- Yeah.
- The Greek Mafia?

408
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,160
Oh, my God, these words
that are coming out of my mouth

409
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,662
- don't make sense to me.
- They're more of a syndicate...

410
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,682
- Oh, Jesus. Okay.
- ...whatever that is, but look,

411
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,541
we have to stay focused
on the positive.

412
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,793
Nobody knows where Steve is right now,

413
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,212
and as long as he's safe, then we're safe.

414
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,941
Okay, I don't understand how the fuck
you can be positive right now.

415
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,967
Because what other choice do I have?

416
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,011
Okay, the man I love is dead.

417
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,346
That's why I'm gonna stay focused

418
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,515
on whatever it is
that I need to stay focused on

419
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,559
so that I can get through that. Okay?

420
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,642
Okay.

421
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,188
- I should check on the salmon.
- Go on.

422
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,356
And I, uh, put a pie in the oven.

423
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,482
- You made pie?
- Yeah.

424
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,110
- What kind?
- Cherry, of course. Your favorite.

425
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,034
I'm on a diet.
I gained ten pounds this summer.

426
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,615
- You look beautiful.
- No.

427
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,783
I wish you would love yourself more.

428
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,581
Mmm! Judy, this is so good.

429
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,791
And I only eat, like, seven things.

430
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,751
Thank you.

431
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,712
What'd that cop want earlier?

432
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,219
- Oh.
- The, um...

433
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,513
- The lady... Yeah.
- She actually...

434
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,475
- She wanted to discuss what happened...
- Yeah.

435
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,645
- ...at that intersection yesterday.
- Oh, yeah.

436
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,232
She agrees with me that she thinks that
there should be more stop signs, so...

437
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,523
- That's why she came to our house?
- Yes, that's why she came to the house.

438
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,613
- I'm not stupid.
- No, you are not. You're very smart,

439
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,115
and you should be very proud
of your mother.

440
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,661
She's trying to do something very positive
for the community.

441
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,216
Anybody gonna get the door?

442
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,348
Hello.

443
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,396
Detective Perez.

444
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,606
Man, I thought you were my tacos.

445
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,191
Yeah, sorry to disappoint.

446
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,736
I wanted to tell you that you were right.

447
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,195
About what?

448
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,492
Judy Hale and Steve Wood were responsible
for the Harding hit-and-run,

449
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:30,956
but there is so much more going on there,
and I could really use some help, if...

450
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,874
- you're interested.
- Wait.

451
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,586
Are you offering me a job right now?

452
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,880
If you pass a psych test

453
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,468
and a breathalyzer.

454
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,596
Why would I want to work with you

455
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,057
or Hastings, for that matter?

456
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,476
That shady racist,
is he still chief of police?

457
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,438
He's also a misogynist, but yeah.

458
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,188
Then, no.

459
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,068
But, uh...

460
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,615
Wow.

461
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,375
I did some digging.

462
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,961
Might be something useful in here.

463
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,049
Okay, well, if you change your mind...

464
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,508
Sorry to stop by again.

465
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,763
I was in the neighborhood because
I purposefully came to this neighborhood

466
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,181
to just do this.

467
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,390
Anyhoo.

468
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,308
Anyway.

469
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,686
Uh, found this at my parents.
I believe this is a Judy Hale original.

470
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,812
Oh, my God.

471
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,232
I painted this for your mom, like,
five years ago for Christmas.

472
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,794
You sure I can have it back?

473
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,112
- It wasn't prominently displayed.
- Oh.

474
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,461
- Well, thank you. That's so sweet.
- No, that's very sweet of you.

475
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,409
- We should probably...
- You wanna come in?

476
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,871
I mean, sure.

477
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,372
Great.

478
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,588
Judy, this pie is amazing.

479
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,671
Thanks.

480
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,969
Uh, can I get you some beer or some wine
or something?

481
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,388
Thank you. I don't drink.

482
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,098
How about tea?

483
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,184
Oh, I will get crunk on some chamomile.

484
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,559
Okay.

485
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,647
Hey, Mom, can I go outside
and look for Dad Bird?

486
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:19,940
It's probably dead.

487
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,276
Hey! Char.
Don't listen to him. Yes, you may.

488
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,195
I'm just being real with him.

489
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,071
Somebody should be.

490
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,114
Come on, bro...

491
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,536
I'm sorry about that. He's...

492
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,123
He's just been going through a lot
since his dad died.

493
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,206
Oh.

494
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,835
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

495
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,546
I have a teenager too.

496
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,924
And I know it's not the same thing,
but when his mom and I got a divorce,

497
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,428
he, um... vandalized a Carl's Jr.

498
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,764
That I can get behind.

499
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,309
Hey, um, thank you for inviting me in.

500
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,371
It's nice to be somewhere outside
of my parents' house.

501
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,522
They're just pacing and stressing
and worrying.

502
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,606
- Really?
- Yeah.

503
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,859
And Judy's totally right.
Steve is down in Mexico.

504
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,987
Oh. She told you that?

505
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,989
Yeah, we went to his office together.

506
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:10,907
Got it.

507
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,285
Yeah. This whole thing was just...

508
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,287
It's peak Steve.

509
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,624
You know, I used to always say,
wherever Steve goes, chaos follows.

510
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,836
- Here's your tea.
- Mmm!

511
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,212
You like extra honey, right?

512
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,840
- Oh, honey me, honey.
- I remembered.

513
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:31,428
I'm already feeling it.

514
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,762
Mom, I found Dad,

515
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,598
- and he's not okay. Come on!
- What?

516
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,312
Come on.

517
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,981
- Mom, you gotta do something.
- Oh, God, okay. Um...

518
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,901
- I don't know.
- What if I can climb up on the freezer?

519
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,503
- Oh, no, you don't have to...
- Yeah? No?

520
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,167
- I think it's just too low for you.
- Oh.

521
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,697
- What about a ladder?
- Ladder, yes.

522
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,199
- Um, over here.
- Great.

523
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,158
Hang on, little fella.

524
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,288
- Oh, great.
- All right.

525
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,582
Judy's got it.

526
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,878
Come here. Come here, little birdie.

527
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:08,215
Come on. Ow, ooh, I got you.

528
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,509
I got you.

529
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,220
Hi, friend.

530
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,765
Hi.

531
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,356
Wow, what a beautiful backyard.

532
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,023
Thank you.

533
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,026
Oh, God.

534
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,488
You must live in that pool.

535
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,657
Not really.

536
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,202
I'd die to get in that pool.

537
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,453
You ready?

538
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,998
But what if he never comes back?

539
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,127
I like to think if you love someone,

540
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,463
they're always with you,

541
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,215
no matter where they go.

542
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,260
Okay. I'm ready.

543
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,640
Look. He didn't wanna go.

544
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,315
Well, look at that, he stayed.

545
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,818
Yeah.

546
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,901
Oh, how about that?

547
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,698
Looks like he's not ready to leave
just yet, is he?

548
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,615
Yeah, not yet.

549
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,075
Thank you for handling that.

550
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,911
- How long have you had him?
- Well, um, he's my dad.

551
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,454
It's a good thing you were here.

552
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,290
And he'll continue to be.

553
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,791
I'm glad it's a good thing.

554
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,587
Judy, I...

555
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,048
I'm sorry.

556
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,718
It's okay.

557
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,293
Oh. You're not a dad bird, are you?

558
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,422
You're a mom.

559
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,212
<i>What did you do?</i>

560
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,423
<i>What do we do?</i>
