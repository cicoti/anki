Why are you here?

46
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,551
I, um, I lost some people recently.

47
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,639
And I just didn't want any more time
to go by before I saw you again.

48
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,475
You're my mother.

49

00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,831
Part of me thought
I'd never see you again.

53
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,405
I just figured you didn't want anything
to do with me.

54
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,489
Mom...

55
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,909
I sent you all those letters.

56
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,619
I kept trying.

57
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,914
I just thought that you didn't want
to see me.

58
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,289
I wrote you back.

59
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,208
You did?

60
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,500
Of course.

61
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,085
I never got 'em.

62
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,981
- And then you never called me, so I just...
- No, don't. Come on, don't.

63
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,966
Look, you did the right thing,
staying away.

64
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,344
And I never worried about you.

65
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,722
The world has always loved taking care
of you.

66
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,641
With that face.

67
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,318
How long are you gonna be in here
this time?

68
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,112
I don't know. Could be five, could be ten.

69
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,447
I haven't decided.

70
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,531
But I'm all right.

71
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,659
Really, I'm good.

72
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,201
I'm sober.

73
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:09,123
This is actually the most peace I've felt
in a long time.

74
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,292
- Really?
- Mmm.

75
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,880
You know how exhausting it is
to hide and lie all the time?

76
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,592
I got here,

77
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,471
it was like I could finally exhale.

78
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,807
Right.

79
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,311
It's not the worst thing,

80
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,188
paying the price.

81
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,690
Yeah.

82
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,444
I could see how that would be a relief.

83
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,246
Hi. I'm still here.

84
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,329

85
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,624

86
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,167
No. I'm not.

87
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,003
Yeah, feels like you are a little bit.

88
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,421

89

You're with somebody new,
and it's scary and weird.

90

Okay.

151
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,863
And, um...

152
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,909
you take good care of your mom, too.

153
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,702
Sure.

154
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,299
- You're living in Laguna? Fancy. Fancy.
- Mm-hmm.

155
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,217
Who's the fella?

156
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,968
Oh. No, no fella.

157
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,472
I live with my friend Jen
and her two boys, Charlie and Henry.

158
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,308
Oh. You don't have your own family?

159
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,726
No.

160
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,687
But I have them.

161
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,149
Hmm. Well, motherhood's overrated anyway.

162
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,654
Two minutes.

163
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,615
Oh, Frankie,
can't I just get a little bit more?

164
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,077
I'm catching up with my daughter.
Isn't she beautiful?

165
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,621
I see the resemblance.

166
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,677
You can have five minutes, just this once.

167
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,253
Thanks.
Don't think I didn't notice that haircut.

168
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,217
- I don't know how you do it.
- Mnh-mnh.

169
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,052
And still making friends
everywhere you go.

170
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,012
Mmm. You need 'em in this place.

171
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,808
How'd you end up back here?

172
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,768
I can't really talk about it.

173
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,062
But it's the system.

174
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,733
Once you go in, they make it almost
impossible for you not to come back.

175
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,445
Right.

176
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,702
I'm sorry, Mom.

177
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,370
Look...

178
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,705
you were a kid.

179
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,584
They shouldn't have let you testify.

180
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,335
I think about it all the time.

181
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,169
I just...

182
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,465
I had to tell the truth.

183
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,009
Yeah.

184
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,137
You didn't know better.

185
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,392
Look, that's in the past.

186
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,185
Let's live for the future.

187
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,812
All right.

188
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,109
I'd really like to see you more, Mom.

189
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,445
Oh, baby, I'd like that too.

190
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,449
Rumor has it,
I have a parole hearing coming up.

191
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,452
Maybe I'll get out sooner than later.

192
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,535
Really?

193
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,832
Especially if I have a lawyer this time
who didn't get his degree at Costco.

194
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,003
- But good attorneys don't come cheap.
- No.

195
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,175
God, I would love to help you, Mom,
but I don't have any money.

196
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,593
Oh, no, no, look,

197
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,763
if you can't show up for me like that,
you can't.

198
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,936
Well, maybe I can try.

199
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,606
That would mean a lot.

200
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,986
Morning.

201
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,031
- Hey, Mom.
- Hello.

202
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,492
So I saw Ben
coming down the stairs earlier.

203
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,284
Ben was here?

204
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,914
Uh, yeah, he was here for just a second
to talk about some real estate stuff.

205
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,290
In your bedroom?

206
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,374
Yes.

207
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,379
Well, he seemed upset when he left.

208
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,046
He did?

209
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,090
Yeah.

210
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,216
Oh, shut up!

211
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,510
I didn't say anything.

212
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,595
No, honey, I'm sorry.
It's not you, it's...

213
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,307
The city council
denied my stop sign petition.

214
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,558
- Seriously?
- Why?

215
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,744
I don't know, it doesn't say.

216
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,063
It's just an impersonal rejection
from some faceless assholes.

217
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,190
So that's it?
We did all that work for nothing?

218
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,528
No. That's not it.

219
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,616
- Where are you going?
- To make them tell me to my face.

220
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,751
- Can I come with you?
- Uh, no, you may not.

221
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,387
You are gonna finish your breakfast,
and when you're done eating,

222
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,016
you're gonna take your bowl
to the dishwasher for once in your life.

223
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,084
I'm on your side. Why are you mad at me?

224
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,253
I'm not, I'm just covering my bases.

225
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,724
I mean, I've done the research,

226
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,226
and the numbers are very compelling.

227
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,563
I'm just very passionate about this.

228
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,066
So I think, in terms of medians...

229
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,235
we shouldn't.

230
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,410
Hi. Jen Harding,

231
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,622
real estate agent, mom,
and I am here to say no.

232
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,541
To medians?

233
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,876
No, to you.

234
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,085
I beg your pardon.

235
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,171
I submitted a proposal for a stop sign

236
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,506
that was just rejected by this council,

237
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,759
so I am here to reject your rejection.

238
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,136
Well, I'm sorry,
but this is the median hearing.

239
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,013
Well, now we're gonna
talk about stop signs.

240
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,515
Well, unfortunately,
that request was denied

241
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,351
because stop signs slow down traffic.

242
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,604
Uh, that's the point.

243
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,857
After review, the board actually felt
that it could do more harm than good.

244
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
I'm sorry,

245
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,735
who's a stop sign gonna harm?

246
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,280
Except for some asshole who bought a Lambo

247
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,699
to compensate for his micro dick?

248
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,703
Miss, we really don't need
that kind of language.

249
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,619
Okay...

250
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,746
Please don't call me "miss."
That is annoying.

251
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,372
I'm a full-grown fucking woman,

252
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,876
and I have a teenage son
who's about to get his driver's license,

253
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,336
and I am trying to protect him

254
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,297
and make this neighborhood safer for him

255
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,465
and for all of you.

256
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,883
You know, Mrs. Harding,

257
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,094
I find it interesting
that you're so concerned

258
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,263
about keeping your neighbors safe.

259
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,807
I'm sorry, do I know you?

260
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,726
Yeah, we met. The name's Andrew.

261
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,519
Andrew Peters.

262
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,691
You might remember me from when you
offered me a free estimate on my house

263
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,109
and then assaulted me.

264
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,445
Get the fuck off me!

265
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,113
No means motherfucking no.

266
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,197
You bitch!

267
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,825
You almost broke my nose.

268
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,536
I should have hit you harder.

269
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,119
Excuse me?

270
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,289
Well, you may remember

271
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,375
that the reason I tried to break your nose

272
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,627
is 'cause you were trying
to force yourself on me

273
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,963
after I repeatedly said no.

274
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:04,635
And I said no to you,
not just because you are fucking gross...

275
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,513
but because I had just lost my husband,

276
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,723
and the last thing that I needed

277
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,269
was to be molested
by some smug, horny prick.

278
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,478
That's not what happened.

279
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,442
Well, could have used
a stop sign that day, huh?

280
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,840
Yeah.

281
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,405
And if there had been a stop sign

282
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,408
on the road where my husband was killed...

283
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,660
he might be alive today.

284
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,872
And my boys would still have their father.

285
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,667
And our world wouldn't have fallen apart.

286
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,589
Mrs. Harding, though I'm sorry
to hear about your husband's death,

287
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,258
we don't know that a stop sign
could have saved him.

288
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,970
No, we don't.

289
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,598
But it's one stop sign.

290
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,769
And if there is a chance
of saving someone else

291
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,273
from having to feel how I feel every day
of my life,

292
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,066
then trust me, it is worth it.

293
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,194
Because I wouldn't wish this on anyone.

294
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,656
Even you.

295
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,672
Hi.

296
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:25,883
Miss Hale.

297
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,177
- I think you can call me Judy by now.
- I don't.

298
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,887
Okay. I brought you something.

299
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,184
It's Flo.

300
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,646
I heard she's feeling better.
I mean, not from Michelle,

301
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,874
because she won't return my texts,
which is really hurtful,

302
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,732
- but I...
- Seriously?

303
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,733
Sorry.

304
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,276
Thank you for this.

305
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,361
You're welcome.

306
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,739
I was also hoping that
maybe you could do me a favor.

307
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,033
You think you're in a position
to ask me for favors?

308
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,869
Probably not, but it's about my paintings.
I'm just looking for them.

309
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,331
There's a whole collection of little girls
with holes in their hearts.

310
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,375
- Okay.
- I know it sounds weird,

311
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,498
but they're worth something, and last time
I saw them was at Steve's gallery.

312
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,544
Stop talking.
I have something to show you. Prager!

313
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,050
Hello, Judy.

314
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,679
Hey, Nick.
Good to see you back in uniform.

315
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,055
Uh, is it?

316
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,301
Can you do me a favor and explain
to me what's happening in these photos?

317
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,524
That is not what it looks like.

318
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,068
Oh, that's not Charlie Harding
with Steve Wood's car?

319
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,030
Charlie has nothing to do
with anything about Steve.

320
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,782
Okay, then...

321
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,368
help us understand why
there's also CCTV footage

322
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,620
of Charlie driving Steve's car
the night it was burned.

323
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,206
Well, I...

324
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,875
Look, our boss is itching for us
to make an arrest in this case.

325
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,639
And he thinks we should be looking at you.

326
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,587
- He does?
- He does.

327
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,190
But it's a little hard not
to look at this.

328
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,924
It's our only actual lead.

329
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,802
Yeah.

330
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,321
Well, those are just a few pictures.

331
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,823
They don't tell a very good story.

332
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,057
We know Charlie's angry
about his father's death.

333
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,976
And we know he's had access to a gun.

334
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,538
The question is whether
he was angry enough to use it, which,

335
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,722
- obviously, we're gonna have to ask him.
- He didn't. That's not what happened.

336
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,608
Then what did?

337
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,240
Look, Charlie's the one
who needs a favor now,

338
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,909
so if you got a better story,
you need to tell us quickly.

339
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,837
Char, Hen!

340
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,797
Mama made dinner!

341
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,425
Sort of a once-in-a-lifetime thing here.

342
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,304
Probably gonna taste like shit,
but that's my love just tasting like shit.

343
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,722
Hello!

344
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,602
Hey, Boop. Dinner's ready.

345
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,520
I'm not hungry.

346
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,606
Hmm? No? What's going on? Are you okay?

347
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,109
- I got into a fight with Shandy.
- Oh.

348
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,986
I don't want to be her friend anymore.

349
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,320
Why?

350
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,239
You guys can't talk it out?

351
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,950
I mean, Shandy, you know, seems like...

352
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,994
very reasonable.

353
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,371
She killed my bird.

354
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,668
- She did?
- I know you told her to lie about it.

355
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,879
Oh.

356
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,589
Why did you do that?

357
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,675
I don't...

358
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,385
I don't know, honey.

359
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,012
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,389
I just... I knew how upset you were
about the bird,

361
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,851
and I just didn't want you
to feel any worse.

362
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,186
But I do feel worse.

363
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,022
You're my mom,
and you fucking lied to me.

364
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,525
Yeah, um...

365
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,862
Look, I... I made a mistake, okay?

366
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,574
Moms make mistakes sometimes.

367
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,952
I'm really sorry, honey.

368
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,329
What can I do to make it up to you?

369
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,872
Do you want to go to the arcade?

370
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,667
No.

371
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,921
But maybe when Judy gets home,
she can come up to my room?

372
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,882
Okay.

373
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,974
You have your bird, huh?

374
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,600
Yeah, but...

375
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,562
somehow its... its tail broke.

376
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,689
Yeah.

377
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,778
All right, well, I love you.

378
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,616
Okay.

379
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,957
- Hey, we need to fucking talk.
- What? Oh, God, what now?

380
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,894
I'm not Henry. You don't have to hide shit
from me. You don't have to lie.

381
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,479
Okay, what are you talking about, Charlie?

382
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,503
Everything.

383
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,008
Ben, Steve.
I know you're the one who burned his car.

384
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,136
You had a fucking gas can in your hand.

385
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,180
Look, you don't know
what you're talking about.

386
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,515
Okay? It's none of your fucking business.

387
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,100
It is! It is my business.

388
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,145
You're my mother. Aren't we supposed
to look out for each other?

389
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,189
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

390
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,025
So you need to drop it, okay?

391
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,318
- What...
- Trust me.

392
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,861
Why can't you tell me

393
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,630
- what the fuck is going on?
- Because I can't.

394
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,780
- Why not?
- Because.

395
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,865
Why?

396
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,202
Because I'm scared.

397
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,706
Steve Wood...

398
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,502
was involved
with some very dangerous people, okay?

399
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,006
So you, please,

400
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,718
don't say another word
about this ever again.

401
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,844
Do you understand me?

402
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,928
Yeah.

403
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,766
Not another word, Charlie.

404
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,851
Okay.

405
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,106
What? What is that?

406
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,609
Nothing.

407
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,670
<i>You don't really think the kid did it.</i>

408
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,914
I'm just going off the evidence.
It's all we have.

409
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,627
- Did you take a look at what I gave you?
- I did.

410
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,712
But we need more.
A couple of photos of a guy

411
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,607
walking into an art gallery
doesn't prove much.

412
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,675
Neither does a couple photos
of the kid in the car.

413
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,305
Prager, my man, those phones
aren't gonna answer themselves.

414
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,307
So, um...

415
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,186
what did Judy Hale have to say
for herself?

416
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,562
She's not talking yet.

417
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,398
Did you dangle the kid?

418
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,275
I... did.

419
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,527
- Good girl.
- I'm not your girl.

420
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:19,986
Sorry.

421
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,282
I thought that would be a compliment
for a woman your age.

422
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,908
Bitch.

423
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,631
Hey.

424
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,428
I need to see you in the garage, please.
Now.

425
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,266
Really? Just... fuck. Okay.

426
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,643
Hey, hey.

427
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,313
What's going on?

428
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,313
What's going on?
Judy, just tell me what's going on.

429
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,945
The police have pictures
of Charlie driving Steve's car,

430
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,069
the ones that Parker took.

431
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,572
Oh, my God.

432
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,533
They also have him on CCTV...

433
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,203
- driving the car the night it was burned.
- Oh, my God.

434
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,913
They think he did it, Jen.

435
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,124
No, no, no, no.

436
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,834
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

437
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:16,918
What am I gonna do?

438
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,837
- What am I gonna do, Judy?
- Nothing.

439
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,921
Oh, my God.

440
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,381
- Listen to me. Nothing.
- What?

441
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,050
I'm gonna take the blame.

442
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,886
What? No, no, you're not.

443
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,846
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

444
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,515
- Oh, fuck, no!
- You are going to let me do this.

445
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,433
I need to do this.

446
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,809
Oh, my God, Judy.

447
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,894
- No.
- Yes.

448
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,228
Listen to me.

449
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,315
The night that Steve died...

450
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,943
I was gonna kill myself.

451
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,403
What?

452
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,988
But then you called me,

453
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,865
and you saved me.

454
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:48,909
Oh, Judy.

455
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:52,245
And maybe you saved me for a reason,
so that I can do this for you now.

456
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:53,997
You have a family.

457
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,414
You have a life.

458
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,667
Please let me do this for you, Jen.

459
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,628
I'm responsible for all of this.

460
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,831
If it wasn't for me,
none of this would have happened.

461
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,549
You're not responsible for Steve's death.

462
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,550
I am.

463
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,135
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

464
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,596
He came here looking for me,
and then he attacked you.

465
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,514
No.

466
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,392
- Yes, it was self-defense, Jen.
- No, it wasn't.

467
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,309
Yes, it was.

468
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,685
No, it wasn't, Judy.

469
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,604
What are you talking about?

470
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,899
He was walking away.

471
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,487
And he didn't attack me, okay?

472
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,321
I attacked him.

473
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,620
- No, you said that he was strangling you.
- No, I...

474
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,703
I lied.

475
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,747
You what?

476
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,831
I lied.

477
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,290
I'm sorry.

478
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,379
No, I don't understand why you...
why would you do that?

479
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,840
Why... why would you kill him?

480
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,811
<i>He was looking for a way out, honey.</i>

481
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,680
- What?
- Ted. He jumped in front of our car.

482
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,892
- No.
- Oh, yeah, he wanted to get hit.

483
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,728
Fuck you.

484
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,331
You know what? I don't fucking blame him,

485
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,251
because if I was married to you,
I'd want to put a fucking gun to my head.

486
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,069
I'd want to kill myself, too,
you miserable cunt!

487
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,202
'Cause he was saying
some really bad things, okay?

488
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,080
And I got really angry and I...

489
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,581
I just lost it.

490
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,210
What did he say to you?

491
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,962
I can't... it doesn't fucking matter.

492
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,464
- Yes, it does.
- No.

493
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,608
- What did he say to you?
- No, it doesn't...

494
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,759
It obviously matters,
'cause you fucking killed him.

495
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,123
What the fuck did he say to you?

496
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,346
He said that Ted jumped
in front of that car!

497
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,809
Okay? He said that
he wanted to die because of me.

498
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,817
- You know that's not true, right?
- It's true.

499
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:46,901
No, it's not.

500
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,654
None of that is true.
That's just what Steve did.

501
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,989
He wanted to hurt you.

502
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,450
That's how he was.

503
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,368
No, he was right, Judy.

504
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,413
I'm... I'm a piece of shit.

505
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,500
I'm a fucking piece of shit.

506
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,462
Ted fucking hated me,

507
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,340
my kids fucking hate me,
I fucking hate me.

508
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,717
Everybody just fucking hates me.

509
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,802
I don't hate you.

510
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,825
- I could never hate you...
- Oh, God,

511
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,433
that's because you love anyone who just
gives you a morsel of fucking attention,

512
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,768
even if it's abusive.

513
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,853
It's like you get off on it or something.

514
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,982
It's why you loved Steve and why you love
your shitty, fucking asshole mother!

515
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,485
You'll just stick around for anybody.

516
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,788
Shit.

517
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,457
Judy, wait.

518
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,125
Stop, stop, stop, stop, please.

519
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,336
Look, I didn't mean it, okay?
I didn't mean that.

520
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,605
No, listen to me. Listen to me.

521
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,257
Listen to me, stop.
I am so sorry. Okay, listen. Listen.

522
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,843
It's okay to be angry. You should be
fucking irate right now. I deserve that.

523
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,238
- Don't.
- You should punch me in the face.

524
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,429
- Come on, please.
- No.

525
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,931
- Come on, hit me, please.
- No.

526
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,454
No, wait, just punch me in the face.

527
