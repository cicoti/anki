1
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,883
The fuck am I doing?

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,263
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Oh, my God.

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,810
Fuck! Fuck! I fucking hate doing this.

4
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,854
I can't do this. I can't do this.

5
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,188
- Eggs are ready.
- Huh?

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,606
- Oh, Jesus.
- Shit.

7
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,026
You know, you didn't have to stay.

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,820
You need to eat something.

9
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:29,946
I can't. I...

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,216
I honestly don't think
I'm ever gonna eat again.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,950
Come the fuck on!

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,434
- You kidding me?
- Hi, Mom.

13
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,787
Judy's back! Hi!

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,289
- Hey. Morning.
- Hi!

15
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,416
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

16
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,960
Thanks for my bird.
Oh, I should go get it.

17
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,044
Huh? No, uh, no.

18
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,922
Uh, sweetheart, why don't you just
go have your breakfast right now?

19
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,317
Then get your shoes on. I don't want you
to be late for the bus.

20
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,677
I thought Judy wasn't gonna be
in our lives anymore.

21
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,429
You guys are friends again, or...

22
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,222
- Uh...
- Um...

23
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,067
- I'd like to think that's the case.
- Not really, it's not like that.

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,436
- I'm hoping...
- She came to get the rest of her things.

25
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,562
- Got it.
- So...

26
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,188
Oh.

27
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,484
- Um, where are all of my things?
- I burned them.

28
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,778
Even my paintings?

29
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,696
Look, I was upset.
There was only, like, two.

30
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,574
- My friend Parker just got a car.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,117
And Jake is getting his mom's Lexus.

32
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,410
Oh, my God. No!

33
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:18,952
Charlie, I can't.

34
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,431
I've had my permit for, like, a week.

35
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,641
- She won't even let me practice driving.
- Okay, got you.

36
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,375
Charlie, please, not now. Please.

37
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,170
Okay? I've... I've had
a really long night, and, um...

38
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,255
you will practice.

39
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,924
Okay? I promise you, honey.

40
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,529
Now fucking drop it...

41
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,694
...and go to school.

42
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,718
Thank you.

43
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,347
Why is the pool cover on?

44
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,602
The pool cover?

45
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,980
- Um, well, we thought that it was...
- Something died.

46
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,942
- What?
- A squirrel.

47
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:49,901
Dog.

48
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,236
- Spider... dog.
- It was a dog.

49
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,154
- A dog died in the pool?
- Yeah.

50
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,448
- A big one.
- Yeah.

51
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,612
I lost my appetite.

52
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,344
- It was old.
- The dog would've wanted you to eat.

53
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,202
It was very old.

54
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,685
- I think it might have killed itself.
- Okay, that's enough.

60
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,141
I ran out of lighter fluid.

61
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,269
I, um...

62
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,604
I guess we...

63
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,983
should talk about what we...

64
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,112
shouldn't talk about
before we don't talk again.

65
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,325
Yeah. Yeah, we should.

66
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,705
No one can ever know what happened
or where Steve...

67
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,707
I know. I'm not stupid.

68
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,293
You know what,
I'm hearing you say, "I know,"

69
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:52,088
but I also know that you tend
to get a little confessy.

70
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,300
Well, I got confessy with you
because I couldn't let you believe

71
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,383
that you were responsible
for your husband's death.

72
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,637
You lied a long time, though.

73
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,347
I did, so you know I can.

74
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,057
- Oh, you can.
- Yeah.

75
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,101
And I promise you,
the last thing I want right now

76
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,453
is to put you in any more danger.

77
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,687
Oh, you know what?

78
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,190
It's too fucking late, Judy.

79
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,276
I am in a lot of fucking danger now.

80
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,131
I just don't understand how any
of this could have happened.

81
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,155
I told you.

82
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,823
Okay?

83
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,910
He got in my face.

84
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,330
And he tried to strangle me.

85
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,416
And it was very scary.

86
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,545
And I had to fight back
because my boys were inside.

87
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,132
Okay, but don't you think
the police would understand?

88
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,800
That was self-defense.

89
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,844
Yes, it was. It was,

90
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,513
but what am I gonna...
How's it gonna look if I go to the cops?

91
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,890
Steve killed my husband.

92
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,243
And you're the one who fucking told me

93
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,329
that his family's
so fucking connected to the police.

94
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,833
They are. The chief is his godfather.
It's just a title, but...

95
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,984
Not to mention my fucking house
would be a crime scene, and...

96
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,779
I'd be opening my boys up
to an investigation.

97
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,883
That would be very hard to come back from,
developmentally.

98
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,451
They already lost their dad.

99
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,329
- They can't lose me, too.
- No, you're right. You're right.

100
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,748
I just... I was suggesting
going to the police

101
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,918
because I know how hard it is
to hide something.

102
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,419
It takes a toll.

103
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,005
I just feel so bad.

104
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,529
Okay, you know what?
I don't need your fucking pity right now.

105
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,303
What I need is for you to keep quiet.

106
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,597
Okay.

107
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:33,606
I'm so sorry that I started
this shitstorm.

108
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,740
And I just can't believe that he's gone.

109
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,260
- Except he's not.
- But he is.

110
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,202
- Right? No.
- No, he's not.

111
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,372
You need to act like he's not.

112
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,333
Right. Right.

113
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,543
Right.

114
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,306
All right. Um...

115
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,101
Well, thank you for your help last night.

116
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,965
- Feel free to call me if you ever need...
- Goodbye, Judy.

117
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,487
Bye.

118
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,451
Bye.

119
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,943
Don't get any closer to me.

120
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,198
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me
where the fuck Judy is.

Whoa, cute skirt.

135
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,526
Uh, they're pants.

136
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,028
Oh. Yeah.
You should get them in every color.

137
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,907
- Technically they're culottes, I guess.
- That's tricky.

138
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,494
Listen, I wanted to ask you,
I hope it doesn't sound weird,

139
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,497
but do you think that I could crash
in Abe's room just for a week or two?

140
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,958
- I'm sorry?
- Don't be sorry, I have my own bedding,

141
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,626
but it's just that I miss him a lot,

142
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,754
and I thought that maybe I could
scratch that itch by sleeping in his room.

143
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,548
Also, I do need a place to stay.

144
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,734
I thought Angela said you were living
with your family.

145
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,094
Oh, I was, but now I wasn't, so...

146
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,096
It didn't work out
the way I thought it would.

147
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,850
Okay, well,
a new resident is moving into Abe's,

148
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,393
and we're at capacity, so...

149
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,646
Oh, wow, that's great, full capacity.
I love that for us.

150
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,315
Right?

151
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,567
But you have a place to stay. I mean...

152
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,818
You got people, right?

153
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,570
- Oh, totally.
- Yeah.

154
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,653
Totally, totally.

155
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,696
- Good.
- Totally.

156
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,686
- Hey, neighbor.
- Oh.

157
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,356
Jesus Christ, Karen,
snuck up on me like a fucking Prius.

158
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,816
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you.

159
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,235
Wondering if you want to have
some orange wine tonight.

160
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,770
Jeff's in Boston on business.

161
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,823
Uh, no, I... what the fuck is orange wine?

162
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,949
I don't really know.

163
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,493
I saw it on a Reddit subthread
about menopause, so...

164
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,787
Oh, cool. No, I, um...

165
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,748
I really need to go to bed early tonight,
so...

166
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,126
- You end up having a late night?
- Huh? No.

167
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,086
No, why?

168
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,171
Oh, I just thought
I heard a man back here.

169
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,464
Oh, well, yeah.

170
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,215
Must have been Charlie.

171
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,677
No, it sounded like a full-grown man.

172
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,139
Well, you got me.

173
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,432
I was...

174
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,393
I was fucking a full-grown man last night.

175
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,811
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,313
Sounded more like an argument.

177
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,814
Well, you don't know how I fuck.

178
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,733
Right.

179
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,652
Okay, so listen,
I really need to get back to...

180
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,571
Didn't you just get
these cameras installed?

181
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,572
Jesus Christ.

182
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,074
I did, but, um, I changed my mind.

183
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,701
Oh, I'm not surprised.

184
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,345
I didn't wanna say anything,

185
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,538
but Jeff and I really prefer
the system we have.

186
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,416
- It's the same one the Mossad uses.
- Cool.

187
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,252
You should see the resolution
on our street cam.

188
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,629
Your what?

189
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,966
Our street cam. You could see
the whole block. It's like a movie.

190
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,763
You know what?

191
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,221
Fuck it.

192
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,059
Why don't we have that orange wine
right now?

193
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,978
Uh, it's 11:30 a.m.

194
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,979
Be cool, Karen.

195
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,190
Okay, yeah.

196
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,901
- All right, great.
- Sounds cool.

197
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,129
- Why are you standing? Go get it.
- Okay, yeah.

198
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,153
- Go get it.
- All right.

199
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,909
Fuck me. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

200
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:45,955
Where is it?

201
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,796
- Oh! Hi, is this not 140?
- Oh.

202
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,715
Oh, no, it is. Thank you.

203
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,676
This is it?
This is where you're dumping me?

204
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,344
Yes, Mom.

205
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,431
This is where I've spent my life savings
to make you comfortable.

206
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,725
This is a wonderful room.

207
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,288
Best one in the place, if you ask me.

208
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,728
See? Thank you.

209
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,604
I'm Judy.

210
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,649
I was just, you know, making sure
everything's perfect for you.

211
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,361
Thank you, Judy.
This is my mom, Flo, and I'm Michelle.

212
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,445
- Hi.
- Are you the maid?

213
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,782
- No, I teach arts and crafts.
- Oh.

214
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:26,996
So is crawling around on the floor
an art or more of a craft,

215
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,581
- would you say?
- Both.

216
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,543
You know, I like to make sure
there's a tight tuck, 'cause...

217
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,892
'cause sometimes people really like that.

218
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,006
I'm good at it, so I hope that's okay.

219
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,758
Yeah, no worries.

220
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,967
No, none, no.

221
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,344
Great. Great.

222
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,555
Well, it was wonderful to meet you...

223
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,183
Flo. Bye.

224
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,309
See you guys.

225
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,312
Keep her away from me.

226
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,814
Mom,
there was no way she didn't hear that.

227
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,634
The quality is amazing, right?

228
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,454
No, it's great, but is it even legal
to spy on people like that?

229
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,081
Oh, there's basically
no privacy laws anymore.

230
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:11,999
Oh.

231
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,019
It's one of the reasons
I'm glad I live in this era.

232
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,170
- Oh, right. That's...
- Yeah.

233
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,755
Not that it matters.

234
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,965
Nothing interesting ever happens
on our street.

235
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,927
Except for whatever happened
in this backyard last night.

236
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,304
- What?
- You know, with the...

237
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,763
fucking.

238
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,641
Oh, yeah.

239
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,726
The... fucking.

240
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,353
YALO. Or is it YOLO?

241
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,771
I don't know, Karen.

242
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,023
Okay. Look, it even has night vision.

243
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,398
Oh.

244
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,237
- That's last night.
- Wow, that's... that's really clear.

245
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
Mm-hmm.

246
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,786
Do you like the orange wine?

247
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,496
Yeah, yeah, it really coats the mouth.

248
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,289
Um...

249
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,085
How do you erase this? Do you erase this
every day, or how do you erase it?

250
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,170
Uh, I don't. I keep it all on the cloud.

251
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,968
What is that noise?

252
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,857
Wait, what are you doing?

253
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,300
What the fuck? What are you doing?

254
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,277
- There's a sound coming from your drain.
- Huh?

255
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,946
You don't want anything stuck in there.

256
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,658
Could be a nightmare.

257
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,162
- Yeah. Yep.
- Hmm?

258
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,083
Here's the culprit.

259
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,296
Yeah, that's just a toy. It's just a...

260
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,423
Shouldn't be in there.

261
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,007
Kinky.

262
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,218
Oh.

263
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,402
<i>Hey-o, you've reached TKG Arts,</i>

264
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,655
<i>Laguna's leading art gallery
for local and international artists,</i>

265
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,532
<i>showing by appointment only.</i>

266
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,076
<i>You know what to do.</i>

267
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,287
- Hey, Judy.
- Oh, hey.

268
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,914
Is there a lost and found here?

269
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,541
I found this cigar box someone left
in the room.

270
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,044
You know, hidden in the box spring?

271
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,504
Oh, weird, someone left that there.

272
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,672
Yeah, it's super weird.

273
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,883
And I definitely didn't look inside

274
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,261
to see that there was a bunch of weed
and some car keys.

275
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:45,985
Thank you.

276
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,364
Oh, okay.

277
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,451
Your hair smells so good.

278
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,204
Thanks?

279
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,624
You're welcome.

280
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,504
Okay, now you just,
please, just be careful. Go slow.

281
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,607
- Mom, it's fine.
- Get your eyes on the road, please.

282
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,091
I know. I know.

283
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,096
Yeah. How... how do you know how to drive?

284
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,182
Dad taught me.

285
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,143
Oh. He did, huh?

286
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,896
Or he was teaching me,
right before he died.

287
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,524
Was he?

288
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,820
It was actually really cool,
driving with him.

289
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,243
I'm glad that you got
to spend that time together.

290
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,371
Why didn't you tell me?

291
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,625
He said not to.
I guess he didn't want to piss you off.

292
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,423
Watch out!

293
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,842
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

294
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,343
- Yeah, I'm... Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

295
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,555
Watch where you're going, you asshole!
It's a fucking intersection,

296
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,157
- motherfucker!
- He can't... He drove away!

297
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,201
- Could've killed someone, fucking cunt!
- Calm down.

298
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,351
He can't fucking hear you.

299
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,437
Fucking don't fucking cuss at me!

300
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,853
Thank you, Abe.

301
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,025
So I was looking online,

302
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:52,738
and we can actually petition
to get a stop sign at that intersection.

303
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,157
- Nothing happened.
- Hm?

304
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,950
You... you're overreacting.

305
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,410
Okay, well, I'm not.

306
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:03,207
And you know what? Don't ever tell a woman
that she is overreacting, okay?

307
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,459
Because most of the time,
women are underreacting.

308
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,338
This is my reaction,
which means that I am reacting perfectly.

309
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,756
Is Judy coming back?

310
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,341
- They broke up again.
- Char.

311
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,343
You break up a lot.

312
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,679
Can we go eat in front of the TV?

313
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,681
Fine.

314
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,123
Mom! Mom!

315
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,630
- Hey. Hey, Boop. Boop.
- Mom.

316
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,425
Boop, honey.
Are you okay? Did you have a bad dream?

317
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,427
- Yeah.
- Oh.

318
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,805
You want to tell me?

319
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
Well...

320
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,853
I was alone in a room.

321
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,066
And... and someone...
someone was taking you away.

322
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,822
Oh. Do you...

323
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,617
Do you know who it was?

324
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,244
I'm not sure, I couldn't tell.

325
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,329
Oh. Yeah, that...

326
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,374
That is a bad dream, huh?

327
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,166
Yeah.

328
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,544
Do you know what?

329
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,632
You know it was just a dream...

330
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,051
because I'm right here.

331
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,514
You are not alone.

332
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,767
You'll always have me.

333
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,478
Okay?

334
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,856
You'll always have your mama.

335
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,368
Close your eyes.

336
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,022
Hi.

337
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,024
Hi.

338
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,526
<i>Hi.</i>

339
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,947
I didn't think you'd answer.

340
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,157
I didn't think you'd call.

341
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,079
You left your, uh... bracelet here.

342
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,832
<i>Oh. Sorry. I, uh...</i>

343
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,001
You can just throw it out, or...

344
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,587
burn it or whatever.

345
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,215
Oh.

346
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,927
Thought maybe you left it here on purpose.

347
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,889
Like, as an excuse to see me again.

348
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,104
Did it work?

349
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,358
What's that sound?

350
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,446
<i>Where are you?</i>

351
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,573
Um, I'm, uh...

352
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,242
parked outside of my old dentist's office.

353
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,911
<i>- Dr. Nguyen?</i>
- Yes.

354
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,455
You go to him too?

355
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,125
Shit, I was gonna roll up the window,

356
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,127
but I fell.

357
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,338
<i>I guess it took Mrs. Garrett's crisis
to bring us together.</i>

358
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,050
<i>Yeah. How much longer are we gonna
have to keep up this act?</i>

359
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,681
<i>We'll just have to keep this up
until she's over her little problem.</i>

360
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,308
<i>Then everything'll be back to normal.</i>

361
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,118
<i>Yeah. We don't want to break...</i>

362
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,811
Thank you for having me over.

363
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,107
Well, I'm not gonna
have you sleeping in a car.

364
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,402
I slept in a car for,
like, a year with my mom.

365
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,738
Really?

366
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,989
Mm-hmm.

367
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,950
Might have been a year and a half.

368
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,411
Wasn't that bad. It was a hatchback.

369
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,624
Oh, God, Mrs. Garrett.

370
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,668
Oh.

371
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,879
Don't you wish that you had a Mrs. Garrett

372
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,340
just tell you that
everything's gonna be all right?

373
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,423
Yes.

374
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,762
Everything is gonna be all right.

375
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,347
That's not as good.

376
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,556
- No?
- No.

377
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
Sorry.

378
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:26,024
I don't know what to do, Judy.

379
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,778
This... this feels impossible.

380
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,532
Oh, no. I know.

381
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,158
I know you know.

382
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:39,829
I'm right here.

383
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,707
Okay.

384
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,256
I didn't realize I had it so good

385
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,258
when I was just, like, regular unhappy.

386
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,341
Yeah.

387
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,428
God, I would kill for some
down-the-middle depression right now.

388
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,222
Just some real good,

389
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,224
- deep dissatisfaction.
- Yeah.

390
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,313
Shit. I'm sorry.

391
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,026
It's like I forget for a second,
and then I just remember about Steve.

392
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,152
Yeah.

393
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,196
I know we weren't even
together,

394
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,699
but suddenly,
I can't imagine my life without him.

395
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,204
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry, Judy.

396
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,333
I'm so...

397
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,086
- I'm so, so sorry.
- No, no, no. Don't be sorry.

398
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,423
He was attacking you,
and it was not your fault.

399
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,718
Yeah.

400
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:41,516
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me
where the fuck Judy is.

401
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,560
Please just leave.

402
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,497
I don't know why the fuck
you're protecting her.

403
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,856
She just feels sorry for you.

404
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,316
Poor little widow, all alone,

405
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,526
cheating husband.
Boy, he was miserable, wasn't he?

406
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,070
Fuck this! I'm out of here.

407
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,246
- Judy.
- Yeah?

408
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,208
Can...

409
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,629
Can I... can I give you a hug?

410
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,988
- No, no, no, really.
- Really?

411
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,448
Yeah. No, it's fine.

412
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,242
I mean, you can stay
until you find somewhere permanent.

413
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,286
Okay, and to be clear,
you burned all of my stuff?

414
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,913
Well, not your blanket.

415
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,124
And some of your crystals
wouldn't take the hint,

416
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,208
but...

417
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,669
Oh, also...

418
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,840
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

419
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,466
Hey.

420
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,844
Parker's gonna be driving me to school.

421
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,471
Oh, is that a telling, not an asking?

422
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,555
Pretty much.

423
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,972
Guess you guys can't stay away
from each other, huh?

424
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,936
Hey.

425
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,272
Oh, excuse me. Wait a minute.

426
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,316
Do I know this Parker,
and does he have a license?

427
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,485
Uh, yeah, she does.

428
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,905
Wear a seat belt, please!

429
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,159
- Do you think that they're...
- No.

430
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,789
Coming.

431
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,340
