1
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,303
You want to confess something?

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,806
Wait, how do you even know where I live?

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:20,061
I dropped Judy off here one night
when she was... was...

4
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,646
Didn't, um...

5
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,233
- This is about something else.
- Okay.

6
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,194
Oh. Oh, God. Oh, God.
What's happening here? Um...

7
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,697
You... you okay?

8
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,617
I'm sorry. This isn't professional.

9
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,537
No, no, it's fine, you're fine.
It's... it's, uh...

10
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,457
Hmm. Why you crying?

11
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,543
- I don't want to get into it.
- Okay.

12
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,795
- Michelle left.
- Oh.

13
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,841
- She moved out.
- Oh. Wow. I'm so sorry.

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,218
Bad timing on my part.

15
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,470
I mean, yeah, okay,

16
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:59,976
I guess I maybe was just holding out hope
that we would get back together.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,227
Oh, yeah.

18
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,731
But no, she just thinks that I lost myself
in my job,

19
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,150
that I always see the worst in people.

20
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,652
Oh, I'm sure that's not the case.

21
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,363
Do you think I want to be a cop
all the time?

22
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,200
You think I like being the person
people are afraid of?

23
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:19,829
"Oh, let's not invite her to game night.
She'll arrest us all for smoking pot."

24
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,165
That's not even illegal anymore.

25
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,792
Okay, well, it's a bad example,

26
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:28,004
but it's really hard to "turn it off" when
you're dealing with criminals all day.

27
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,630
Right.

28
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,216
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,967
No, it's... it's okay.

30
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,553
- I'm sorry.
- Take your time.

31
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,724
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

32
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,810
Okay.

33
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,231
Okay.

34
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,817
What did you want to say?

35
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,321
- I killed Steve Wood.
- Oh, Jesus Joseph Christ.

36
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,093
<i>"I don't know where to begin.</i>

37
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,410
<i>I just know this has to end.</i>

38
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,979
<i>I know you think you're the reason
all our problems started,</i>

39
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,874
<i>but they existed long before we met,</i>

40
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,668
<i>and I'm so glad that we met.</i>

41
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,464
<i>You are the best friend I've ever known,
the best person I've ever known.</i>

42
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,218
<i>You're a better mother to Charlie
and Henry than I could ever be.</i>

43
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,696
<i>I know that they may not be
the kids you dreamed of,</i>

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,181
<i>but I'm hoping you'll find it
in your enormous heart</i>

45
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,976
<i>to take care of them
and be their legal guardian.</i>

46
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,271
<i>I'm so sorry I lied to you.</i>

47
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,273
<i>I'm sorry I betrayed you.</i>

48
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,442
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't
forgive you sooner for Ted.</i>

49
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,779
<i>But no matter what you think,
you've paid the price.</i>

50
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,823
<i>Now I need to do the same."</i>

51
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,581
This seems right.

52
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,416
How much farther?

53
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:51,462
Um, I think we're close.
Okay. All right. It's this way.

54
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,632
Morning.

55
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,116
- Good morning.
- Hey.

56
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,594
Beautiful day, huh?

57
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,803
- Yeah.
- It's great.

58
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,430
Come on, Daisy.

59
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,682
- Have a good one.
- Thanks.

60
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,017
- Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait.

61
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,060
- Walk me through this again.
- Okay.

62
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,980
- Mr. Wood showed up at your house, angry.
- Yeah. Very.

63
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,816
And I asked him to leave, and he wouldn't.

64
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,380
You know, my kids were upstairs.
I was worried that he would...

65
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,238
Anyway, he said some things
that really upset me,

66
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,450
and I don't know, but something
inside me just took over,

67
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,573
and the next thing I know,

68
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,202
he was...

69
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,040
If I was married to you, I'd want
to kill myself too you miserable cunt.

70
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,751
<i>What did you do?</i>

71
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,586
Dead?

72
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,046
Yeah.

73
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,299
Why'd he show up at your house
in the first place?

74
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,718
He was looking for Judy.

75
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:53,983
Hey, good morning.

76
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,067
Hi!

77
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,527
Oh, nice, you made pancakes?

78
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,989
Sure did! With some chocolate chip action,
your favorite.

79
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,241
Aww, thank you.

80
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,035
Is Mom coming down?

81
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,413
Um, she's not here.

82
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,705
Where is she?

83
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,435
She probably went for a run.

84
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,710
Yeah, she probably did.

85
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,503
Who's hungry?

86
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,629
Oh, I am.

87
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,175
There you go. Well, you better dig in.

88
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,979
Get all up in there
while they're still hot.

89
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,470
Aren't you gonna have some?

90
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,430
Yeah.

91
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,514
Cool.

92
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,558
I'll be right back.

93
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,403
Judy, hey!

94
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,862
Hey, hey, Karen!

95
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,572
- Getting an a.m. jog in?
- I sure am.

96
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,490
- Me too!
- Yeah.

97
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,616
Not sure if you heard,

98
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,744
- but Jeff and I are separating.
- Yeah, I did, I'm sorry about that.

99
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,622
Yeah, working on my revenge bod
before I hit the dating apps.

100
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,832
Forget that, you look great.

101
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,208
- Oh, thanks.
- Sure.

102
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,211
Hey, if you ever want a run buddy,
we can get a little Google Cal...

103
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,046
Okay, no worries.

104
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,882
You got your own flow going.
I totally respect that.

105
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,385
It was fun catching up!

106
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,345
Wait, slow down.

107
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,640
You're telling me you dragged his body
through these woods with no help?

108
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,475
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I was a dancer.

109
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,352
- Very strong core.
- Yeah, right.

110
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,520
Okay, look.

111
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,189
I know you have a photo of Charlie
driving Steve's car.

112
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,234
Okay, but he got the car from my storage.

113
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,988
He is a teenager
with an underdeveloped frontal lobe,

114
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,532
and he saw something he wanted,
and he took it.

115
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,616
He's an idiot.

116
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,910
But he is not a killer.

117
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,332
All right, you know what?

118
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,126
Yeah, this is looking very familiar to me.

119
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,187
That's because we've just circled back
to where we were.

120
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,172
Wait, wait. We did? Are you sure?

121
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,548
No. Are you?

122
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,091
No.

123
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,136
I... I know
he's around here somewhere, okay? I...

124
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,345
Oh, wait, is that...

125
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,097
No. Damn.

126
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,616
Oh, come on,
we've been at this long enough.

127
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,080
We're going back to the car
before <i>our</i> bodies are never found.

128
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,853
Oh, Perez, wait!

129
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,398
Oh, hey.

130
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,901
Where's my mom?
I know she didn't come home last night.

131
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,527
Is she okay?

132
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,611
Yeah.

133
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,697
- No, um...
- Judy.

134
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,782
- I don't know.
- Judy.

135
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,116
Please tell me the truth.

136
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,035
Is... is she in danger?

137
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,454
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

138
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,290
She told me Steve was involved
with some dangerous people,

139
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,376
and I found this in his car.

140
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,252
I was too scared to give it to her.

141
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,462
What is this?

142
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,552
I don't know.
There's a bunch of shit in there.

143
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,678
I tried to read what was
on the thumb drive,

144
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,514
but it's all in some weird language,

145
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,516
- like Hebrew or...
- Greek?

146
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,683
Okay.

147
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
Okay.

148
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,066
Thank you for giving this to me.

149
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,402
It was a very responsible thing to do.

150
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,487
I'm super proud of you.

151
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,710
Please, just give me
20 more minutes, okay?

152
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,991
- An hour, tops.
- No.

153
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,661
Just... I can find him, please.

154
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,541
Charlie had nothing to do with this, okay?

155
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,627
What about Judy Hale?

156
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,254
She have something to do with it?

157
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,515
I'm assuming she's the one who told you
we had the picture of Charlie.

158
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,799
Did she blackmail you to say
that you did it alone?

159
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,323
- She write you another check?
- What?

160
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,012
No, no.

161
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,308
Judy's broke, and she would never.
She's a fucking angel on Earth.

162
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,604
I did this. Alone.
Judy is completely innocent.

163
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,191
God, what the hell is it about that woman?

164
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,151
What?

165
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,237
It's like she puts a spell
on every goddamn person she meets.

166
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,823
She told you she ran over your husband,

167
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,667
and yet you somehow still seem to think
that she's some goddamn peach.

168
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,120
Please explain to me how that is possible,

169
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,265
because from where I'm sitting,
none of it makes sense.

170
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,083
Okay, I know how it sounds, all right?

171
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,338
I wanted to hate Judy. I really did.
But it's impossible.

172
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,507
It's like hating a baby or something.

173
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,508
You just can't.

174
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,177
- Why?
- I don't know. It just...

175
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,264
She sees the good in people.

176
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,017
Even when it isn't there.

177
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,119
Hey.

178
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,203
Hey...

179
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,956
Hi. I have some information
on the Steve Wood case.

180
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,600
- You know, the tip line's anonymous.
- Yeah, I heard about that.

181
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,045
But I want you to promise me,

182
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,889
if I give this to you, you're gonna do
everything you can to help Jen.

183
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Help Jen with what?

184
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,382
Help her...

185
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,385
- Wait, did she not come in here?
- No.

186
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,869
- What?
- Why does she need my help?

187
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,138
I meant, like,

188
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,767
just in case she ever finds herself
in a position where she needs help,

189
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,479
I want to help make sure
that you help her.

190
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,231
Okay.

191
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,985
This belongs to Steve.

192
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,279
I happened upon it recently.

193
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,575
You happened upon it?

194
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,411
I don't think he wanted anybody
to find it.

195
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,916
You know,

196
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,337
I heard about those voicemails
that he left you.

197
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,880
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,216
- What did you hear?
- Oh, nothing that surprised me.

199
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:15,137
Though I'm still trying to figure out
why you'd stay with a guy like that.

200
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,016
Yeah,
I'm trying to figure that out myself.

201
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,770
I guess I thought maybe
you get what you deserve.

202
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,732
Nobody deserves that.

203
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,069
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

204
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,866
I listened to that recorder thing
to see if it was anything.

205
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,953
Play it somewhere private.

206
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,123
Where the Chief won't be able
to hear himself.

207
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,500
Okay.

208
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,382
Oh, shit.

209
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,347
Oh, shit.

210
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,898
Oh, God.

211
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,484
Oh, God, my kids are awake.

212
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,738
Am I allowed to get in...
Can I make a phone call?

213
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,281
- Sure.
- Okay, thanks.

214
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,201
Oh, no. Shit.

215
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,486
You'll get better reception
when we're out of the woods.

216
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,875
It doesn't matter.

217
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,086
Like, how am I...

218
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,048
How am I gonna explain this to them?

219
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,884
I mean, I know I have to, but it's like...

220
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,387
They already had such a shitty hand
dealt to them with their dad, and I...

221
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,764
One job...

222
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,602
as their mother, one fucking job,
and I failed.

223
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,066
You said he was threatening you.
You said you asked him to leave.

224
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,318
He has a history of abusive behavior.

225
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,445
That'll carry weight in a courtroom.

226
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,528
Yeah, well...

227
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,158
Steve's family has a lot of connections
around town.

228
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,534
Yeah, I'm aware.

229
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,663
I'm pretty confident that...

230
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,083
...nobody's gonna take pity
on the angry woman who attacked him.

231
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,877
You don't know that.

232
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,840
I do know my kids
are gonna lose their mom.

233
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:22,098
And I know how it fucking destroyed me
when I lost mine.

234
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,186
When did your mom pass?

235
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,231
Uh...

236
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,109
when I was 19.

237
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,695
From breast cancer.

238
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,950
I lost my mom when I was young, too.

239
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,788
Was she... was she sick?

240
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,084
She was murdered.

241
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,210
Oh, God.

242
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,046
She was trying to protect me
from my stepfather.

243
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,719
She sounds like a good mom.

244
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,305
She was.

245
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,934
I miss her every day.

246
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,477
Me too.

247
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,440
Every day.

248
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,613
- Reception's back.
- Oh, okay.

249
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:24,201
Um, so what happens now?

250
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,414
Um...

251
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,419
All right.
Well, we'll, uh, go back to the station.

252
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,336
Okay.

253
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,006
You'll give a statement,
with a lawyer present if you choose,

254
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,632
and you will be formally charged.

255
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,968
Okay.

256
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,803
Okay.

257
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,223
- That's standard procedure.
- Right.

258
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,645
But you're gonna go home.

259
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,564
Huh?

260
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,736
And we are never gonna talk about
what we didn't find out here ever again.

261
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,780
What... what?

262
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,906
We were never here.

263
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:06,118
Okay, I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't think I understand.

264
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,287
I just...

265
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,625
I don't want to be a cop right now.

266
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,544
I want to be a person.

267
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,549
And sometimes justice just
works itself out.

268
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,594
So go home to your kids.

269
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,347
Tell them you love them.

270
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,899
Because someday
they're gonna miss hearing it.

271
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,022
Oh, my God.

272
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,609
Thank you.

273
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,906
Thank you.

274
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,710
Judy, is my mom still out for a run?

275
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,672
No.

276
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,132
- Oh, I hope she's okay.
- What is that?

277
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:03,967
Um...

278
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,847
Can you guys sit down for a minute?

279
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,264
Why?

280
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,393
'Cause I want to talk to you
about something that's really important.

281
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,399
Your mom loves you so, so much.

282
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,234
Oh, shit.

283
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,820
And I love you so, so much.

284
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,322
Yeah, we love you, too.

285
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,406
Thanks.

286
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,366
And...

287
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,096
I just want you to know
that no matter what happens,

288
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,955
you guys are gonna be okay.

289
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,497
Okay?

290
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:35,999
Okay.

291
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,084
Okay.

292
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,256
- Your mom is...
- Hi.

293
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,551
- ...coming through the door right now.
- Mom!

294
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,011
Oh, God.

295
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,098
That's not really
the greeting I was expecting.

296
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,351
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I am. I am. Are you?

297
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,978
Yeah.

298
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,440
- Hey, Mommy.
- Hi, baby. Oh, God, I love you.

299
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,444
- I love you both so much.
- We know.

300
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,613
Okay.

301
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,200
Listen, I, um...

302
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,120
I just want to explain the letters.

303
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,622
Nope. Nope, you don't.

304
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,788
What letters?

305
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,625
I didn't, uh...

306
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,293
- You didn't?
- No, I didn't.

307
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,629
Good.

308
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,352
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

309
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,674
The...

310
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,843
- surprise.
- The surprise,

311
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,637
'cause your birthday is coming up.

312
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,556
So there's little surprises,
little surprises...

313
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,315
I don't get it.

314
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,193
Trust me, I was there, and I have
no fucking idea what just happened.

315
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,778
- She just let you go?
- Yeah.

316
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,237
- What?
- I mean, I...

317
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,406
I couldn't find him, so...

318
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,577
Well, I carved a heart in the tree
right where he was, so we could find him.

319
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,098
Well, that would have been useful to know
two hours ago.

320
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,922
I didn't know you were going there.
I thought you were going to prison.

321
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,544
Well, that's where I fucking should be.

322
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,922
Well, maybe there's a reason you're not.

323
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,883
Like what, I'm going to cure cancer
or something?

324
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,801
Maybe.

325
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,636
I mean, you'd really have to focus.

326
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,978
I can't believe you're sitting here.

327
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,856
How can you even look at me?

328
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,110
I'm so sorry.

329
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,364
Judy, I'm so sorry that I lied to you

330
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,367
and let you blame yourself.

331
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,411
Fucking horrible thing to do.

332
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,203
It is.

333
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,248
You didn't deserve that.

334
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,165
I didn't.

335
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,464
If I were you, I would get up right now

336
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,968
and walk away
and never fucking talk to me again.

337
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,810
I forgive you.

338
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,562
What?

339
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,566
- I forgive...
- Oh, shut up.

340
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,526
No, you shut up.

341
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,864
I don't want
to carry around any more pain.

342
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,283
I'm tired...

343
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,411
of feeling sad and hurt.

344
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,830
Okay.

345
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,165
And resenting you...

346
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,168
would just be punishing myself.

347
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,128
- So...
- I don't want you to do that.

348
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,130
I don't want <i>you </i>to do that.

349
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,258
How can I not?

350
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,886
I think you have to find a way.

351
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,722
You need to forgive yourself.

352
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,058
- Ew.
- Yeah, I know, it's gross.

353
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,645
But I feel like you've been given
a second chance.

354
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,773
Well, we both have.

355
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,149
Yeah.

356
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,946
I'm sure there's stuff
I have to work on too.

357
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,073
Uh, yeah.

358
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,741
Well, that was a quick response.

359
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,909
I'm open.

360
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,288
You need to start saying "no" more.

361
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,793
I know.

362
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,045
- It's disgusting.
- It is hard.

363
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,255
Oh, God.

364
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,049
I know it's early, but...

365
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,801
can we start drinking?

366
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,594
Do I have to start saying no yet?

367
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,221
You can start tomorrow.

368
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,889
Oh, good, I thought that was a test.

369
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
Then yes.

370
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,154
I love you.

371
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,156
I love you too.

372
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,669
So I'm starting to realize that I...

373
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,464
I never really grieved the death
of my mom.

374
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,092
Oh, baby.

375
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,679
Thanks. Um...

376
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,058
I was...
I was 19 when she died, and, um...

377
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,769
At the time, I was...

378
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,981
I was relieved, you know?

379
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,817
She had been sick for most of my life.

380
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,193
I think I was nine

381
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,196
when she was first diagnosed, and um...

382
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,199
She'd be okay...

383
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,452
then the cancer would come back and...

384
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,498
and I would be mad...

385
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,501
at her every time, like it was...

386
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,840
like, something that she was doing,
that she was choosing it.

387
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,013
And then, um...

388
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,226
When her body couldn't fight anymore,

389
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,563
I was mad at her because she couldn't.

390
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,902
And I think I've been mad at myself

391
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,029
for that ever since.

392
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,239
That's rough.

393
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,868
Thanks, Linda.

394
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,537
I'm glad you decided to come back, Jen.

395
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,123
Me too.

396
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,298
Oh, boy.

397
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,304
Thanks, Yolanda.

398
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,892
I wasn't sure if you'd be back.
Don't want to get my hopes up.

399
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,477
That's funny.

400
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,145
Why's that funny?

401
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:34,024
'Cause that's how I used to feel
when I was a kid, when you'd disappear.

402
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,150
Okay.

403
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,569
We're getting into it.

404
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,071
- We're not.
- Feels like we are.

405
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,324
We're not. I just want
to have a clean slate with you.

406
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,202
I'm not trying to make you feel bad, Mom.

407
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,038
It was just hard not knowing

408
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,999
where you were or what you'd be like
when you came home.

409
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,793
Okay.

410
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,212
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,342
But it was hard for me, too.

412
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:01,968
Okay.

413
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,263
You were a tough baby.

414
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,973
You never slept.

415
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,474
You were always crying.

416
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,268
Just really needy.

417
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,646
I was just a kid myself.
I couldn't handle it.

418
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,357
That's why I started using.

419
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,279
A baby can't make you a drug addict.

420
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,573
Of course not. That's not what I'm saying.

421
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,535
Still really sensitive, huh?

422
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,328
Yeah, I still have feelings.

423
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,747
You've always had a good heart.

424
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,458
You know, I was telling Paula,

425
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,752
she's my friend in here,

426
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,422
what a good girl you are.

427
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,508
That you're gonna help me get a lawyer,
get out of here.

428
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,304
You know, I tried to find the money, Mom,
but I couldn't.

429
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,015
Oh. That's too bad.

430
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,432
Sorry.

431
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,352
Don't worry about the money.

432
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,354
You know what would help me even more?

433
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,816
Is if you wrote a letter
to the parole board

434
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,526
telling 'em I've changed,

435
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,445
that I'm better, you know, all that.

436
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,823
They said that would really mean a lot,
coming from you.

437
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,536
Would you do that for me, Judy Anne?

438
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,207
No.

439
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Why not?

440
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,383
You haven't changed.

441
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,435
Daisy! Daisy, where'd you go, girl?

442
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,771
Hey!

443
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:37,897
Oh!

444
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,942
Hey, did you find something?

445
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,403
You digging for bones?

446
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,991
Daisy, what are you digging for?

447
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,591
- Hi.
- Hello, Miss Hale.

448
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,843
I have something for you.

449
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,804
What?

450
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,057
Thank you. Where did you find them?

451
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,976
They were just sitting
in some police lockers. No big deal.

452
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,354
You don't know what this means to me.

453
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,357
- Really.
- Consider it a thank you.

454
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:26,446
That bag of Mr. Wood's you "happened upon"
was extremely helpful.

455
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,257
Did you listen to the recordings?

456
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,592
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.

457
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,094
Of course.
But did you hear Hastings' voice?

458
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,161
- Miss Hale.
- Sorry. Is he gonna get in trouble?

459
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,374
Well, suffice it to say, Hastings will
no longer be chief of police.

460
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,668
- Is he going to jail?
- No.

461
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,462
He's going to federal prison.

462
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,673
Along with a few of his Greek friends.

463
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,427
Wow. Wow, wow, wow! Look at us!

464
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,221
Working together to take down the man.

465
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,764
All right, goodbye, Miss Hale.

466
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,517
Hey, Detective? Wait.

467
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,896
I just wanted to say that...

468
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,441
I think you're a really special person.

469
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,112
I sincerely hope I never see you again.

470
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,659
I feel like you don't really mean that.

471
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,476
Hi.

472
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,730
I'm sorry.

473
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,537
<i>♪ You had plenty money, 1922 ♪</i>

474
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,624

make a fool of you... ♪</i>

475
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,583
I can reframe it.

479
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,015
Holy fuck!

480
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,518
I told you they were worth something!

481
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,978
Jesus!
What are you gonna do with all of it?

482
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,730
I mean, you can't put in the bank.

483
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,589
I don't want to put it in the bank.

484
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,282
I don't think I understand.

485
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,200
I'm buying you out.

486
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,220
- That's what it's called, right?
- Yeah, that's it.

487
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,056
Uh, this should cover what you gave us
for the down payment on the house,

488
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,206
plus interest.

489
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:45,961
Are you trying to buy me out of your house
or out of your family, Jennifer?

490
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,879
The house, Lorna, okay?

491
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,047
Just chill out, please.

492
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,217
Look, you are the boys' only grandmother,

493
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,801
and I am...

494
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,137
- Oh, here we go.
- You can do it.

495
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,431
...grateful for that.

496
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,934
Okay, now you're weirding me out.

497
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,017
Look,

498
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,854
I don't want to resent you anymore, Lorna.

499
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,648
It is exhausting.

500
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,735
Which is why I can't keep working for you.

501
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,819
Is that why?

502
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,575
Or is it because you landed
a $20 million listing?

503
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:22,247
Actually, Lorna,
I want to give you the Wood estate.

504
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,583
As a parting gift.

505
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,877
Are you about to kill yourself?
What's happening?

506
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,213
- No, I'm fine.
- She's fine. You're fine, right?

507
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,298
- I'm fine.
- Yeah.

508
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:36,344
Just please promise me that you will
take care of Mrs. Wood.

509
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,012
Okay, she...

510
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,850
she needs a friend who understands
what she's going through right now.

511
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,933
Of course.

512
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,686
You two will really get along.

513
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,769
Oh.

514
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,649
For commission on $20 million,
I get along with anyone.

515
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,652
Oh. That's...

516
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,655
Hard to believe
this won't be our home anymore.

517
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,407
I always thought I'd die here.

518
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,244
Oh, I forgot to mention,

519
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,371
your lovely realtor friend
was asking after you.

520
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,540
- She was?
- Mm-hmm.

521
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,626
You should call on her
while you're still in town.

522
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,257
I just hope Stevie will be able
to find us at our next house.

523
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,507
Well...

524
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,762
he could always call, right?

525
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,929
I suppose so.

526
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,349
Why hasn't he?

527
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,686
I don't know, Mom.

528
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,174
Hello?

529
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,555
They did?

530
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,275
Are they sure?

531
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,863
Okay, thank you for letting us know.

532
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,117
Who was that, Benji?

533
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,497
Oh, it's just... just my realtor friend.

534
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,128
Hey, I'm gonna run out
and get some ice cream.

535
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,087
So we have it.

536
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,255
Good idea.

537
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,341
You might want some later.

538
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,149
Judy?

539
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,422
You gotta learn to hide shit better.

540
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,775
Charlie is going to freak out.

541
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,443
You really didn't have to do this.

542
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,570
- I wanted to give him something.
- I know.

543
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,573
I feel like we need a treat.

544
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,657
Yeah, we do!

545
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,159
It's been a year.

546
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,536
- Oh, man, she's been a doozy.
- Oh, my God.

547
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,205
I wanna... I wanna go away.

548
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,831
- Yes!
- Do you want to go away?

549
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,933
- Like, on a vacay?
- Yeah.

550
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,833
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

551
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,504
I was thinking, like,
a hut-over-the-ocean situation.

552
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,589
Ooh, talk to me like lovers do.

553
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,299
- Ew.
- Come on, you know what I mean.

554
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,761
No, like, Bora Bora, pina coladas.

555
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,971
- Getting caught in the rain?
- Judes.

556
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,348
- Okay, no diggity.
- Nope. Judy.

557
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,265
- Yep, no scrubs.
- Okay.

558
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,558
- No more words.
- Nope.

559
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,352
- More than words?
- Nope.

560
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,454
I like the big butts?

561
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,605
- You like the big butts?
- Can we please stop?

562
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,773
You stop... stop!

563
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,193
What? Oh! Oh, shit!

564
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,238
Oh, my God.

565
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,072
Look what you did.

566
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,449
Look what I did.

567
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,636
- That's your stop sign!
- Yeah.

568
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,054
You made that happen.

569
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,621
You're practically a hero!

570
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,665
- No... No.
- Yes!

571
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,351
I mean, you're probably
gonna save somebody's life.

572
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,628
Oh, come on, let's not get carried away.
It's just a stop sign.

573
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:42,841
Well, actually,
I will get carried away if I want...

574
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,111
Jen, Jen.

575
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,404
Jen.

576
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,957
Fuck.

577
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,557
Jen. Jen, wake up.

578
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,154
Oh, my God, are you okay?

579
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,311
What happened?

580
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,605
We got hit.

581
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,900
