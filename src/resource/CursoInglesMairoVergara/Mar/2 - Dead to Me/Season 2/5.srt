1
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,142
- I made you a heart.
- Gross.

2
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,270
Last trap is clear.

3
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,688
You should be good.

4
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,023
Thank you, Slade.

5
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,026
None of them gnawed
into your freezer, right?

6
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,109
- No.
- Mnh-mnh.

7
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,987
You're lucky. It's a solid machine.

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,406
You want it?

9
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:33,824
Seriously?

10
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,910
Dead serious.

11
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,121
I could use it, I've got seven kids,
but...

12
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,206
I can't afford this Cadillac.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,499
- Please take it.
- It's yours.

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,295
Oh, I feel so much lighter
with that freezer out of there.

15
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,255
Ooh, flax crackers.

16
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,632
I am so happy I never
have to see that thing again.

17
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,550
Yeah, right?

18
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,094
It's nice not to have
that constant reminder hanging over you.

19
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,765
Yeah.

20
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,975
Okay, so, go on this ride with me.

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,061
- Yeah.
- Paella tonight.

22
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,772
It's a six-hour process,
but no risks, no reward, right?

23
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,274
Do you know if we have saffron
at the house?

24
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,609
Uh...

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,860
...no, you know, I don't.

26
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,029
And I know that
your back has been hurting,

27
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:14,074
so after dinner, pot gummies, hot tub...

28
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,826
- Ooh, I'm listening.
- Then a documentary about Indian women

29
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,590
who make their own maxi pads.
It's supposed to be really empowering.

30
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,707
You know what else is empowering?
Four bottles for the price of three.

31
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,417
See, that's so lucky.

32
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,087
I'm telling you,
since I sent the petrified rock back,

33
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,617
there's been an energetic shift.

34
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,008
I hope so,
'cause mama needs a fucking break.

35
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,944
There's also that documentary about
the Saudi Arabian women who get to drive.

36
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,700
Is it "Sowdi" or "Sawdi"?

37
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,714
Anyway, I don't know if they get to drive,

38
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,163
or because they already know,
or if they learn to drive,

39
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,706
but it's supposed to be really good.

40
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,543
$263.42.

41
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,087
There's also the one about misogyny
and revenge porn.

42
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,464
Ooh, take a penny, leave a penny!
I love that.

43
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,802
- Oh, sorry, your card didn't go through.
- Oh, just run it again, please.

44
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,513
Uh, I already did. Twice.

45
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,391
Well, then something must be wrong
with your runner thingy.

46
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,226
Or your card's maxed out.

47
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,978
Maybe your card's maxed out.

48
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,021
That doesn't even make sense.

49
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,356
Just take some items out.

50
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,233
Do you really need eight bottles of wine?

51
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,903
Oh, I'm sorry, are you the wine sheriff?

52
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,116
Because I am the dick police and you have
the right to remain fucking silent.

53
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,493
What is your problem, lady?

54
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,287
You're my fucking problem, Tyler!

55
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,705
Eww.

56
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,916
I'm not paying for that.

57
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,669
I'm not cleaning that up.

58
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,004
I will.

59
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,716
- No worries.
- Ah, shit.

60
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,306
- I didn't realize it was that bad.
- Yeah.

61
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,142
- What can I do?
- You got 20 grand I can borrow?

62
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,643
Not liquid, no.

63
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,104
- If I can get my paintings back...
- Oh, Judy, it's...

64
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,647
How else can I help?

65
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,691
You know, there's, like, a...

66
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,860
...like, a hovering that can stop...

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,195
- Oh.
- ...maybe.

68
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,530
- Sorry. Nobody likes a hoverer.
- No, it's okay.

69
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,718
- Is it your back? Do you need your brace?
- Oh, fucking stop!

70
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,618
- Fine.
- I'm sorry.

71
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,701
It's okay.

72
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,456
Look, Judy, you know that I love you.

73
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,582
I love you too.

74
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,252
And I know these last few weeks
have been intense,

75
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,797
but we have hung out every day...

76
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,885
for all the days, and, um, it's been...

77
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,053
Really nice.

78
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,347
Yeah, yeah, but...

79
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,150
Look, I know you have a lot
of love to give.

80
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,182
Thank you.

81
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,644
Uh, but it's getting a little co-dependy,

82
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,980
and, uh, I just,
I kind of need some space,

83
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,440
you know, just, like,

84
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,611
to kind of get my life back on track.

85
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,738
Yeah, yeah. Totally.

86
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,821
- Okay?
- Right.

87
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,783
Yeah, s...

88
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:02,866
Cool.

89
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,996
- Did you want the time to start right now?
- I do.

90
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,289
- Okay.
- Okay.

91
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,917
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

92
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,696
If you need anything, I'm just...

93
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,379
Yeah, I know how close you are.

94
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,339
- Yeah, I'm gonna...
- Okay.

95
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,966
Busy doing some stuff, but...

96
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,049
Okay, great.

97
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,885
Thank you.

98
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,122
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

99
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,465
- An Arby's?
- Mm-hmm.

100
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,011
- I mean, yum.
- Sure, it's great for the community,

101
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,096
but the gallery is, like,
just totally gone.

102
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,225
I just really need
my paintings back, you know?

103
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,102
Well, yeah, of course,
it's your life's work.

104
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,854
I was hoping I could sell them.

105
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,481
You don't happen to know where they are,
do you?

106
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,692
No, I don't, sorry. I could ask Howard.

107
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:21,195
No, don't ask Howard. I mean, he's, like,
super busy. He's got a lot on his plate.

108
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,656
Speaking of plates,
thank you for sharing your lunch.

109
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,992
This sandwich is really
filling the old void.

110
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,075
Of course.

111
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,621
You don't think that maybe they ended up
back at your parents' house, do you?

112
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,248
No, no, sorry.

113
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,707
But, Judy,

114
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,295
I wanted to tell you something.
You were right.

115
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,588
- I was?
- Mm-hmm.

116
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,673
Steve did go to Mexico.

117
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,759
- What?
- Mm-hmm. A month ago.

118
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,738
They have a record of him
crossing the border in a white truck.

119
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,888
Oh, my God.

120
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,033
Did they know what he was doing there?

121
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,768
I don't know, something about car parts.
Is this really homemade?

122
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,954
'Cause this tastes store-bought,
in a good way.

123
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,271
No, I make my own nut butter.

124
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,814
Oh, she's so casual about it.

125
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,068
Anyway, turns out the FBI

126
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,861
is after a much bigger fish.

127
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,739
Okay? So if we can find him
and get him to cooperate,

128
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,325
they'll cut him a deal,
and he'll be okay.

129
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,994
- Really?
- Yeah. That's something, right?

130
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,372
- Yeah, that's really something.
- Okay, so,

131
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,207
- Jude...
- Yeah.

132
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,292
- If you know anything else...
- I don't.

133
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,419
...what he was doing
a few days beforehand.

134
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,980
- I don't.
- If you know where he is...

135
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,672
- I don't.
- If you know, please tell me.

136
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,442
- I wish I did. I would...
- We're desperate.

137
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,717
- You can trust me.
- I do!

138
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,696
All I know is that he was really stressed.
He bought a condo a few days ago,

139
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,760
and then he pulled out of the deal,
which really fucked Jen over financially.

140
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,809
Wait. Jen, your Jen?

141
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,393
Who?

142
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,312
Jen saw him a couple days ago?

143
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,022
Um...

144
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,026
I mean, did I say a few days ago?

145
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,364
I have such a loose grasp
on time. You know me.

146
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,784
Huh.

147
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,169
You fucking idiot.

148
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,755
Stupid fucking idiot.

149
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,090
What did you do?

150
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,343
What did you do?

151
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,096
Tsk. Why can't you just be quiet?

152
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,934
Fucking be quiet, for once.
Why can't you be fucking quiet?

153
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,562
Why can't you ever be quiet for a minute?!

154
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,357
Why can't you ever just shut your mouth
and do what you're told?

155
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,873
- Oh, shit, sorry...
- No, sorry, I just, um...

156
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,000
It's not your fault.
I should have locked the door.

157
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,603
- Are you sure?
- No, yeah, come on in.

158
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,253
I'll wash my hands and be gone.

159
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,300
Are you okay?

160
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,469
Yeah, I'm just... You know.

161
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,929
I'm having a day.

162
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,764
Ugh, me too.

163
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,225
- Fuck this day.
- Yeah, right?

164
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,312
Mercury's in retrograde or something.

165
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,522
- Huh. It's always in retrograde, isn't it?
- Right?

166
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,191
Are you okay?

167
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,818
- Eh.
- Do you want to talk about it?

168
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,906
- God, no. Do you?
- Ugh. My God, no.

169
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,366
Do you want to maybe drink about it?

170
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,912
I really shouldn't, so...

171
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,795
Well, there's a lot of things
we shouldn't do.

172
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,584
Yes.

173
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,463
I would very much like to drink about it.

174
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,807
Oh, hey, Lorna. Lorna. Lorna!

175
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,786
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Well, make it snappy, Jennifer.

176
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,897
I have a promising lunch date
with a one-term state senator.

177
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,651
He saw my <i>Over Asking</i> cover story
and vigorously pursued me.

178
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,236
Why are you walking like a cripple?

179
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,281
Oh, I was playing basketball with Charlie,
and I pulled my back out, so back brace.

180
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,660
What on Earth were you thinking?
You're over 50.

181
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,330
- Uh, no, actually, I'm not.
- Are you sure?

182
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,790
Okay, can I just talk now?

183
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,668
How much do you think I could get
for my house?

184
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,169
You mean <i>our</i> house?

185
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,256
No, I mean, you helped with the deposit,
but it's not your...

186
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,174
I gave you the entire down payment.

187
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,676
My name's on the deed.

188
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,095
- It is?
- Ted insisted.

189
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,346
He did?

190
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,767
Okay, um, anyway,
things are just a little tight right now,

191
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,854
and I have fallen behind on our mortgage.

192
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,900
And I just think it's time
for the boys and I to downsize.

193
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,984
No.

194
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,695
What do you mean "no"?

195
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,698
I won't let you sell the only home
those boys have ever known.

196
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,993
A home filled with memories
of their father.

197
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,162
Your problem isn't your mortgage,
Jennifer.

198
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,540
Your problem is you.

199
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,834
Excuse me?

200
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,711
Your personality's off-putting.

201
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,713
It's affecting your sales.

202
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,172
Well, you know, it's not my fault

203
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,384
that the pregnant couple didn't want
to live in a house with black mold.

204
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,722
The pregnant people closed
on the mold house this morning,

205
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,931
once I stepped in.

206
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,391
Once you stepped in?

207
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,476
They just needed a loving little nudge.

208
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,271
But that's never been your strong suit.

209
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,231
Always bothered Ted.

210
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,816
Just remember,

211
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,821
the only harder sell than a moldy house
is a bitter woman.

212
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,865
No one wants to live with that.

213
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,640
What the fuck is this?

214
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,443
What the fuck?

215
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,545
Fuck off.

216
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,881
Charlie!

217
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,510
This car is such a flex.
Where did you get it?

218
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,554
My mom had it stashed away.
I think it's for my birthday.

219
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,475
It's, like, straight fire.

220
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,477
Should we see how fast it can go?

221
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,894
Fuck, yeah.

222
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,823
Ah! My hair! My hair!

223
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,708
No, no. No. The cameras work.

224
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,668
Uh, just...

225
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,837
you know, too well. Haha.

226
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,340
So I was just realizing
that I don't want the full coverage.

227
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,428
So if there's any way that I could
possibly scale back that...

228
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,178
Mm-hmm.

229
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,141
Gotcha. Yep, yep, yep.

230
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:09,186
No, I know, I signed the contract,
so there's that.

231
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,647
Um...

232
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,485
While I have you on the phone,
do you think you could walk me through...

233
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,947
um, erasing some footage that I have?

234
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,656
Okay.

235
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,032
Yeah, I just...

236
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,703
Mm-hmm. Okay.

237
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,246
Hiya.

238
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,751
- Hi.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to barge.

239
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,753
Janice said to just come on in.

240
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,173
Oh, well, if Janice says it,
then I guess it's fine.

241
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,138
Um...

242
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,183
How can I, um...

243
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,770
What are you doing here?

244
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,271
Oh, right, um...

245
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,065
Don't want to take up too much
of your time, but, uh...

246
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,194
I just had lunch with Judy, and, uh,
she said you were working with Steve.

247
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,822
She did? She said that?

248
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,783
She said he backed out of a deal
or something

249
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,075
right before he disappeared,

250
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,994
uh, said he screwed you over pretty badly.

251
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,913
I wouldn't say screwed, no.

252
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,498
She said "fucked," actually.

253
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,832
Oh.

254
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,127
Yeah, but, uh, you know what?
Deals fall through all the time.

255
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,754
No hard feelings.

256
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,089
Right, right.
Well, did he give you a reason why,

257
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,383
or was he acting weird at all?

258
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,595
You know what? I don't really know him,
so I don't know his baseline.

259
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,239
You may be one of the last people
to see him...

260
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,389
Well, I wasn't.

261
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,059
I mean, I'm sure I wasn't,

262
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:34,563
because he has a lot of associates
and... and, uh, the people.

263
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:35,940
Of course.

264
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,303
- Sorry I can't help you.
- Yeah.

265
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,655
Just one more question. Uh...

266
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,447
Mm-hmm.

267
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,703
Hmm. Do you ever do short-term rentals?

268
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,247
I'm sorry, what?

269
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,374
I just don't know how long
this is gonna go on for,

270
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,960
and I'm living with my mom,
and I love her to death,

271
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,755
but it's kind of like I can't take it
anymore, if that makes sense?

272
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,756
Mm-hmm, it does.

273
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,593
Let me just look
for some short-term listings for you.

274
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,140
Uh, L4-L5?

275
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,642
- What?
- Your back.

276
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,687
Oh, uh, L5-S1. It was close.

277
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,315
How long were you,
um, wanting to...

278
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,776
- to get a place?
- Hard to tell.

279
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,362
I don't know.
We were hoping to find him by now.

280
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,989
People don't just vanish, you know?

281
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,906
Yeah.

282
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,576
Are you okay?

283
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,035
Mm-hmm. I'm fine.

284
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,079
I wouldn't lean over any more.
You're gonna seize.

285
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,581
Okay.

286
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,252
I'm good.

287
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,462
Uh, are you sure?

288
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,132
Uh, yep.

289
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:48,345
Rentals, though you might want
to look at the long-terms, too.

290
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,597
- Are you...
- I'm good.

291
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,432
- Can I...
- No, I'm fine.

292
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,268
Thank you for driving me home.

293
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,745
- You didn't have to...
- No sweat.

294
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,022
Okay, no pressure,
I could do a quick adjustment...

295
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:58,939
- Oh, God, no.
- No?

296
00:14:59,023 --> 00:14:59,857
- No.
- Okay.

297
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,317
No, I'm perfectly fine.

298
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,836
- This is... yeah, I don't...
- Right.

299
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,195
I just need to get to the chair.

300
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,447
- Easy, easy.
- I'm good.

301
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,909
Really, I am. I am...

302
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,540
Yep.

303
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,042
- Yep.
- I'm good.

304
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,962
Okay. Well, that didn't inspire
a boatload of confidence, but...

305
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,298
Aww, shit.

306
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,509
- I'll get that.
- Oh. Okay, thank you.

307
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,805
- Hi.
- Uh, hello.

308
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,642
- Uh, do I know you?
- You do now.

309
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,728
- I'm Ben.
- Hi. Um, that's my friend.

310
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,482
- Hi, Jen.
- Hi, Karen.

311
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,318
Sorry, didn't realize you had company.

312
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,945
Oh, yeah, it's not...

313
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,239
I just cracked open some
orange huh-huh! Are you interested?

314
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,301
You know what, Karen,
please don't open it. Listen.

315
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,159
- It's tight.
- Yeah.

316
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:56,288
I actually pulled my back out,
so maybe later.

317
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,500
After my chiropractor leaves.

318
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,502
- Oh!
- Okay?

319
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,045
Pulled your back out.

320
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,546
I get it.

321
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,758
Uh, you were here the other night, right?

322
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,093
Sorry, what?

323
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,302
- No.
- Yes.

324
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,096
I saw you on my street cam.

325
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,265
Remember, the next day you said
you were with a full-grown man?

326
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,349
I got it right here.

327
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,702
- Karen, shut up.
- It's really...

328
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,726
Shut up.

329
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,151
It's not him.
You don't know what you're saying.

330
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,232
You're drunk.

331
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,530
I'm gonna go get some ice.

332
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,613
Okay.

333
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,079
I'm sorry. Oh, God.

334
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,707
I hope I didn't ruin anything.

335
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,916
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

336
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,378
Just... Jeff's out of town again,
you know, and I just...

337
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,046
I get lonely.

338
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,925
I know. Listen, you're okay.
Can you just go home, please?

339
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,050
Okay.

340
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:52,969
I love you.

341
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,097
I love, love, love, love.

342
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,725
I'm just gonna keep that.
You shouldn't have that.

343
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,768
All right.

344
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,937
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God.

345
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,438
Fuck.

346
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,068
- Hey.
- Hey. I'm sorry about all that.

347
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,739
She's just kind of going through
a rough patch.

348
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,367
Husband's cheating on her with a dude.

349
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,871
Oh. Well, that's gotta make you
take a good, long look.

350
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,164
What was she talking about?

351
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,139
- Huh?
- She said something about the guy

352
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,209
she thought was me,
that was here the other night?

353
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,086
And was it Steve?

354
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:28,921
No.

355
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,089
No?

356
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,633
Sorry, I just...

357
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,137
I assumed that it was
a guy who looked like me,

358
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,474
- and you were working with him...
- Oh, that's... no, no, no, no.

359
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,311
That was a completely other man...
Timothy.

360
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,105
Gotcha. Oh, yeah, no, I'm... yeah.

361
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,774
Sorry about that.

362
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,610
Yeah, and of course you could have had
a million other guys over.

363
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,695
- What?
- Not that you would've...

364
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,782
...had a million guys over.

365
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,992
And maybe you did or...

366
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,787
Yeah, I'm gonna mind my own business,

367
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,165
and I'm going to
just be your "chiropractor."

368
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,876
Um, you should ice it.

369
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,543
Doctor's orders.

370
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,296
Thank you.

371
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,381
- Are you sure you're...
- Yep.

372
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,511
And it's back there.

373
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,304
I'm good.

374
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,364
Fuck.

375
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,245
Hey. You can't be parked here.

376
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,580
This your car?

377
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,166
Yeah, yeah, it's my car.

378
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,507
Well, take it somewhere else.

379
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,842
This is private property.

380
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,264
Oh, my God.

381
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,766
We gotta get out of here.

382
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,061
- Oh, this place.
- Yeah.

383
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,397
Oh! Oh, my God!

384
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,608
- Oh, I love this view.
- I know, right?

385
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,812
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

386
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,863
It's gorgeous.
I've always wanted to come here.

387
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,281
Well, that works out.

388
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,951
- Are you hungry?
- Yes, but it doesn't look open.

389
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,830
Michelle, where are you going?

390
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,166
What are you doing?

391
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,586
- Hey, Chef.
- Hey, Enrique.

392
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,295
"Chef"?

393
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,048
Yeah. They're letting women be chefs now.

394
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,135
What the fuck are they thinking?

395
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,636
I love to cook, too.

396
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

397
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,513
All right.

398
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,242
Get back here and show me what you got.

399
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,977
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

400
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,729
What?

401
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,356
Oh.

402
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,902
You should have seen your face
when you thought I was breaking in.

403
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,529
I didn't know you were such a good girl.

404
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,156
Oh, I'm not.

405
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,033
I don't know.

406
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,660
Got those cute bangs
and that sweet little dress.

407
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,830
It's really just a cover.

408
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,749
All right, what do you want?

409
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,419
Um, what's your specialty?

410
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,503
Making you happy.

411
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,465
- I like that specialty.
- Mm-hmm.

412
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,051
Well, I don't know, surprise me.

413
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,125
I'm only letting you do this
because I'm desperate.

414
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,989
- Oh, if I had a nickel...
- Please don't make me change my mind.

415
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,309
Okay. Um, may I?

416
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,018
Yep.

417
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,773
All right.
I'm really gonna need you to relax here.

418
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,566
- I'm trying. I'm trying.
- Oh, yeah.

419
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,027
- Wiggle your toes.
- Huh?

420
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,862
Just wiggle your toes.

421
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,030
Okay.

422
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,325
He was fucking miserable, wasn't he?

423
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,079
Well...

424
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,832
that loosened something up.

425
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,711
- Yeah.
- Now, hang tight.

426
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,591
Okay. Um...

427
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,219
Cross your arms for me.

428
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,807
I'm just gonna come in here gently

429
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,142
and lift you up just a little bit here.

430
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,603
All right.

431
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,147
Uh, big inhale.

432
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,486
And let it out.

433
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,446
You are one mean fucking bitch.

434
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,291
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. That's okay.

435
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,376
No need to apologize.

436
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,837
You know, we hold a lot of stuff
in our bodies.

437
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,673
Trauma, stress...

438
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,842
anger.

439
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,677
It's healthy to let it out.

440
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,649
February 21st.

441
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,028
- Of course you're a Pisces.
- Right?

442
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,697
You're artsy, and you're loving.

443
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,158
Ooh, maybe a little too loving.

444
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,921
Why do you say that like it's a bad thing?

445
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,746
My friend Jen thinks I'm a little clingy.

446
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,247
Is she a Scorpio?

447
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,916
- Yes.
- Hmm.

448
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,519
Are you a little bit psychic?

449
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,463
Hmm. I'm a Taurus. We know shit. Okay.

450
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,383
I'm gonna need you to try this polenta
before it gets cold.

451
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,809
Oh, my God.

452
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,772
That is the best polenta I've ever had.

453
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,690
Mine is never that creamy.

454
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,025
Eh, it's just butter.

455
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,070
I mean, there, I just summed up
culinary school for you in three words.

456
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,739
Well, good. Now I don't have to go.

457
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,158
So, uh, how did you learn to cook?

458
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,493
Hmm.

459
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,537
I taught myself as a kid.

460
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,123
Oh, right.

461
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,792
Was your mom not around much?

462
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,962
No. No, she kind of
disappeared a lot, so...

463
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,382
So you had to take care of yourself?

464
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,465
Yeah.

465
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,675
And her.

466
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,529
I mean, when she finally would come home,
she'd be so out of it that, uh,

467
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,639
if I didn't cook stuff,
she wouldn't eat, so...

468
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,016
That's a lot for a kid.

469
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,309
Yeah. Thanks.

470
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,980
Um, did you want to talk about that thing
you didn't want to talk about earlier?

471
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,733
It's not really that big of a deal.
I don't know.

472
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:26,530
My mom keeps calling my ex-girlfriend

473
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,073
to complain about me.

474
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,159
So that's a cool thing I got going on.

475
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,578
What's to complain about?
You're so good to her.

476
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,789
Or I'm a selfish dick.
Depends who you ask.

477
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,750
I think it's kind of nice they talk.

478
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,252
My ex's mom hated me.

479
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,546
How long ago did you guys break up?

480
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,591
Oh, a while ago.

481
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,512
Is your ex still in the picture?

482
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,517
<i>No one can ever know what happened.</i>

483
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:57,893
No.

484
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,480
No, it's definitely over.

485
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,691
Got it.

486
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,694
So did it not end well?

487
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,111
No.

488
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,696
But...

489
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,283
I'm just trying to move on.

490
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I hear that.

491
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,535
Hey.

492
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,498
Do you think that crystals are
bullshit nonsense,

493
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,710
or do you think that
they are magical compounds

494
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,295
formed by spiritual energy?

495
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,965
I <i>know </i>they're magical compounds
formed by spiritual energy.

496
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,632
Okay.

497
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,850
I want you to have this.

498
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:37,933
It's my favorite.

499
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,354
- Is this a moonstone?
- Uh-huh.

500
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,860
- Are you really giving this to me?
- Yeah. It symbolizes new beginnings.

501
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,742
To new beginnings.

502
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,825
To new beginnings.

503
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,750
I'm sorry. I'm not usually the biggest fan
of crying in front of strangers.

504
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,711
Oh, hey. You're not the first lady
I've made cry.

505
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,297
- Hmm.
- Sorry.

506
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,632
You do that a lot, don't you?

507
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,134
Uh, make bad jokes?

508
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,554
Well, they're not terrible,
they're just not funny.

509
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,140
Um, thanks for the feedback.

510
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,517
Yeah, sometimes I feel like

511
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,312
Steve got all the confidence in the womb,
and I got the heart defect.

512
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,440
You seem to have a pretty good heart.

513
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,609
Seven surgeries later, yeah.

514
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,195
- It's okay. Something I deal with.
- Hmm.

515
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,340
How about you?
Your back pain, is that a chronic thing?

516
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,449
Yeah, I was a dancer...

517
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,117
- Really?
- ...for a long time.

518
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,786
- Me, too.
- Shut up.

519
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,663
Yeah, Miss Hedley's Dance Academy.

520
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,039
First through fifth grade.

521
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,167
Okay. Okay, this I have to see.

522
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,251
What?

523
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,586
You need to show me.

524
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,589
- You're gonna make me?
- Yep.

525
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,554
This is going to be...

526
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,640
- probably pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.

527
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,202
- Ooh.
- I don't even know what I'm doing here.

528
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,936
I don't know what you're doing either.

529
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,774
I'm not really sure what's happening here.

530
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,057
- Some of that.
- That's just...

531
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,321
No, that didn't work.

532
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,116
Little worm.

533
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,826
Eww.

534
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:22,205
Wait for it.

535
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,332
Word. You're welcome.

536
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,875
That's so wrong.

537
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,103
How about a little <i>Magic Mike?</i>

538
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,727
Okay, now that's where we draw the line.

539
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,340
That's just so stupid.

540
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,010
Oh, God. Wow.

541
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,887
- Man, my heart.
- Oh.

542
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,432
Boy, how bad would you feel
if I died right now?

543
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,267
Sorry, that was...

544
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,560
...another one.

545
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,937
Boy, I just keep them coming,
don't I? Sorry.

546
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,359
What's this? "Say go to stop signs."

547
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,697
Yeah, I probably could have
workshopped that a little bit more.

548
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,699
Eh. Yeah, yeah, maybe.

549
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,576
Hmm. Thanks for the feedback.

550
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,912
Uh, no, my son is starting to drive.

551
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,374
So now I have become that mother
that I hate.

552
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,458
What's that?

553
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,669
A mother who cares about her kid?

554
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,754
Nothing wrong with that.

555
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,882
My poor mom, she...

556
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,511
She's really going through it right now.

557
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,835
She's afraid to leave the house

558
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,169
'cause she thinks Steve'll walk in
and she won't be there.

559
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,267
Yeah, that's tough.

560
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,517
Yeah.

561
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,061
For all of us.

562
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,291
I haven't talked to him in over a year.

563
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,984
- Really?
- Mnh-mnh.

564
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,780
- What did he do?
- No.

565
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,157
I was drinking,

566
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,496
and we got into an argument
over something really stupid.

567
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,666
And...

568
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,585
I just started going off on him.

569
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,340
Everything I ever resented
about him just came, like,

570
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,010
exploding out of me.
I just couldn't keep it down, you know?

571
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,100
Of course, I regret it now.

572
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,811
Yeah, I'm sure.

573
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,565
I've been putting off making amends
with him, and now it's like...

574
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,611
...you know,
what if I don't get to?

575
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,285
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

576
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,580
- put all this on you.
- No, it's okay.

577
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,378
Oh, I'm sorry. It's my son. I have to...

578
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,461
It's okay.

579
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,256
Hey. Hey, buddy.

580
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,384
What?

581
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,094
I told him to rip it out.

582
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,017
I mean, who the hell wants
a black toilet bowl?

583
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,973
No one. How am I gonna tell
if I'm hydrated?

584
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,391
Yeah! Exactly.

585
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,686
You want to see your work.

586
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,937
You gotta take that?

587
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,106
No, it's just my friend Jen.

588
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,692
Wow.

589
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,528
- Who's the clingy one now?
- Right?

590
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,696
Mm-hmm.

591
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,115
But maybe I should just...

592
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,744
Hello?

593
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,458
Oh, my God, what?

594
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,431
What the hell, Charlie?

595
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,993
I didn't think it would run out of gas.
I just took it for a spin.

596
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,162
Run out of gas?
What the fuck are you even talking about?

597
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,562
This was not yours to take!

598
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,106
I thought it was a birthday present.

599
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,733
Hey, I'm Parker.

600
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,779
Get in the fucking car, Parker.

601
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,238
Both of you, in Judy's car, now!

602
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,406
What about my car?

603
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,969
Your car? Oh, no, no, no.
You are never seeing this thing again.

604
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,870
Get in her car.

605
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,289
Oh, fine.

606
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,750
- Holy shit.
- I know.

607
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,394
- Holy shit, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

608
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,420
Just help me
and get them out of here, okay?

609
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,923
- I'll figure it out.
- Okay.

610
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,272
He was miserable, wasn't he?

611
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:23,988
Fucking go!

612
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,740
You are one mean fucking bitch.

613
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,368
I never want to see
your fucking face again!

614
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:32,121
He was looking for a way out, honey.
