1
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,652
- Hey.
- Good morning.

2
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,031
Did I snore?

3
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,241
Sometimes I snore like a full animal.

4
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:37,037
No. You were sleeping like a full angel.

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,955
Mm!

6
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,627
You were talking in your sleep.

7
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,714
- Was I?
- Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,839
What was I saying?

9
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,802
I didn't get all of it,
but you kept saying, "I'm sorry."

10
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:57,849
- That's weird.
- Yeah.

11
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,268
You sounded kind of sad, actually.

12
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,730
Oh, well, that's strange...

13
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,900
'cause I feel really happy right now.

14
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,654
Okay, I know that you're the chef,

15
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,865
but can I make you breakfast?

16
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,575
I make a mean frittata.

17
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,660
- Really? How mean?
- Hmm.

18
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,662
Hmm. Like, very mean.

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,874
Borderline cruel.

20
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,920
Well, I would love
to try your abusive frittata,

21
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,672
but I have to get
to the farmers' market early.

22
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,299
It's chanterelle season, and...

23
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,841
people go batshit.

24
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,844
I don't think you should go.
Sounds dangerous.

25
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,097
I think you should stay here with me.

26
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,890
- I want to.
- I want you to.

27
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,231
You're really hard to leave.

28
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,941
- Good.
- Ooh!

29
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,111
I gotta go. There's, uh...

30
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,739
There's coffee and a grinder

31
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,992
and a French press on the counter,
if you're interested.

32
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,160
I'm very interested.

33
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,453
All right. Get in there.

34
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,915
I love you.

35
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,506
Mm.

36
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,679
Uh, hello.

37
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,933
Oh, hell, no.

38
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,101
Oh, fuck.

39
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,569
Hi! Good morning.

40
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,363
What... This is crazy.

41
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,766
I mean, what are the odds
that we would both know Michelle?

42
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,469
I live here and dated her for six years,
so my odds are pretty good.

43
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,495
Oh, yeah, those are solid odds.

44
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,705
How do you know Michelle?

45
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,292
Uh...

46
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:49,919
Oh.

47
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,381
- Got it.
- Yeah. She's great.

48
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,757
- Nope.
- Okay.

49
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,259
Do you want some coffee?

50
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,387
- Don't offer me my own espresso.
- Okay. Sorry.

51
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,764
Um, that's a cool shirt.

52
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,017
It's a real statement piece.

53
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,119
- Sweet gams, too.
- Shut up.

54
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,061
Okay.

55
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,211
- Do you need to get that?
- I need you to get out of my house.

56
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,862
Okay. Sorry.

57
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,783
Could you tell Michelle that...

58
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,827
I'll just text her.

59
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,042
What?

60
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,171
Thirty-eight. Speeding.

61
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,841
Forty-two. Illegal!

62
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,385
Sixteen. That's just lame.

63
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,846
This is a lot of work
for a stupid stop sign.

64
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,932
Okay, this is not a lot of work, A.

65
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,228
Pushing your enormous head out
of my vagina was a lot of work.

66
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,187
Gross.

67
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,104
You're telling me.

68
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,523
And B, this is a good thing we're doing.

69
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:57,403
All right, I think it's important to
contribute positively to your community,

70
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,365
especially when you have made
some... mistakes.

71
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,492
You sound like Judy.

72
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,868
You know what you sound like?

73
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,453
"...Judy."

74
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,041
- Do you want a turn?
- Yeah, okay.

75
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,125
Okay. There you go.

76
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:13,961
Hey, so...

77
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,547
what's the deal with that guy?

78
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,548
What guy?

79
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,632
That Ben guy.

80
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,468
Um, he's a client.

81
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,887
He's kind of a dork.

82
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,430
Yes, he is.

83
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,099
But he's a nice guy.

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,851
Well, you seem chill with him.

85
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,103
'Cause I'm chill.

86
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,479
I'm, like, the most chill.

87
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,648
Hey, slow down, fuck stick!

88
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,360
- What the fuck!
- Yeah, really chill.

89
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,111
Look...

90
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,447
I liked him. Ben.

91
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,367
I kicked his ass at Cruis'n World.

92
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,411
Well, that's 'cause you're so fast.

93
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,494
Exactly.

94
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,121
Prove it.

95
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,165
Give me that thing. Prove it. Go.

96
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,751
Come on. Go, go, go, go!
Oh, come on, Harding!

97
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,253
Put those knees up!

98
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,131
Oh!

99
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,091
Clocking it. Clocking it.

100
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,861
- Huh. Wasn't that bad.
- All right, let me see.

101
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,345
Oh, you think you could go faster?

102
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,847
Honey, come on.

103
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,933
I'm a middle-aged woman wearing heels,
with a bad back. I'm not gonna...

104
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,185
Hold on, I'm not ready, hold on.

105
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,321
- Hey!
- Well, hello.

106
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,573
Is someone doing the strut of shame?

107
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,949
No shame in this game.

108
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,617
Did you have fun last night?

109
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,369
Oh, I had a great night.

110
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,040
Oh, it was...

111
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,042
Anyways. Yeah. It was good.

112
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:34,959
Good.

113
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,544
Well, you two are very cute together.

114
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,254
- Right?
- Yep.

115
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,672
She's...

116
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,506
awesome.

117
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,886
But, um...

118
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,219
there is one thing.

119
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,699
- Oh, no, what's wrong with her?
- No, no, nothing's wrong with her.

120
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,308
She is... full chef's kiss.

121
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,268
- Okay.
- But, um...

122
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,520
it's just that she has this roommate...

123
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,897
Ew, she has a roommate?

124
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,067
- That's fucking lame.
- It's just...

125
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,361
Wow. Didn't see that coming.

126
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,487
Yeah.

127
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,405
And, um...

128
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,783
it's like a crazy convergence of, like,

129
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,869
a handful of happenstances,
you might say...

130
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,163
Oh, must be Ben.

131
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,164
Why is he here?

132
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,665
I'm showing him more rentals today.

133
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,126
Oh, I thought you looked dressed up.

134
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,420
What? I'm not dressed up.
These are my work clothes.

135
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,631
Yeah, you look like you're gonna <i>work!</i>

136
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,474
You know what?
Eat my fucking butthole, Judy.

137
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,719
I would, but I'm seeing someone now.

138
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,432
Well, fancy meeting you here.

139
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,559
Oh, was I not supposed to...

140
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,404
- No, you were. No, I was just being...
- 'Cause I thought you said...

141
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,356
- You said...
- Never mind. Just come on in.

142
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,750
Just gotta grab the rest of my...

143
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,359
Yeah, sorry. I just...

144
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:45,029
I may be in shock a little.
Uh, I just got some news.

145
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,216
- News?
- What kind of news?

146
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,366
Um...

147
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,867
...they found Steve's car.

148
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,286
Oh, did they?

149
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,207
Yeah, out in the middle of nowhere.
Completely torched. Barely anything left.

150
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,543
- Oh.
- Oh, that's awful.

151
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,711
- Yeah, that's so awful. Um...
- Oh, my God.

152
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:05,591
Because it was so torched, I mean,
how did they know that it was Steve's car?

153
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,511
- The VIN number.
- Oh, the VIN number.

154
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,805
- Oh, that is a miracle.
- Right.

155
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,557
- Yeah.
- I guess it was arson,

156
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,120
'cause whoever lit that car on fire
knew what they were doing.

157
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,519
Oh, really?

158
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,149
But I mean, they don't...
they don't know who did it, right?

159
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,942
No, not yet, but they said that

160
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,956
they think that whoever did it was trying
to send a message, like...

161
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,738
like a smoke signal or something?

162
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,408
- Really?
- Well, um...

163
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,553
But do you think that the police
are gonna be able to find,

164
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,662
like, evidence in the car,
you know, like...

165
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,915
like fingerprints or DNA?

166
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,751
I mean, I don't know.
It's too soon to tell.

167
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,475
Let's hope they find something, you know?

168
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,964
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Fingers crossed.

169
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,924
At least he wasn't in that car.

170
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,885
My family is clinging to that.

171
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,428
Anyone would, yeah, sure.

172
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,638
Anyway, I don't mean to bail on you,
I just...

173
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,973
- No, it's...
- I gotta...

174
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,224
It's fine.

175
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,394
I'm sure looking for condos is not
the first thing on your mind right now.

176
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,563
Yeah, sorry, my family is just spinning.

177
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,064
- I bet.
- I'm sure.

178
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,400
And somehow I got roped
into organizing a vigil,

179
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,651
whatever that's gonna do.

180
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,837
- Oh, my God!
- That'd be nice

181
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,423
- for the community to get together...
- You shouldn't have to do that...

182
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,767
- ...and keep hope alive.
- Alive.

183
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,116
It's good. Yeah.

184
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,328
I'll be honest with you,
any hope that I do have is kind of on...

185
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,997
life support at the moment.

186
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,878
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to get all down about the...

187
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,046
No, it's okay.

188
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,464
- Please. We're...
- Boys can cry.

189
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,632
To us, especially.

190
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,259
- Yeah, I should probably go and...
- Okay, yeah.

191
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,179
...you know, get, uh...

192
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,723
- vigil stuff together, whatever that is.
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,808
I don't even know where to start.

194
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,602
- Oh, it can be really simple.
- Yeah.

195
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,645
Like a...

196
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:42,939
Get some candles.

197
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,107
- Yeah, and some flowers.
- And some hors d'oeuvres.

198
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,026
Oh, food!

199
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,446
I didn't even think of that. Right.
I should be writing this down.

200
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,699
Uh, can you start over?
Where would I go to get, um...

201
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,743
Candles, what, flowers, food?

202
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,804
You're gonna wanna go
to the gourmet food place on Cedar.

203
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,121
- Okay. Cedar.
- Yeah.

204
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,790
And then if you want flowers,

205
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,809
I mean, I always go to Mission View,
but that's a trek.

206
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,835
You don't go to the...
Cedar's not for flowers,

207
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,338
- so you go to...
- No, you get flowers at a separate place

208
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,316
because the flowers at the supermarket
are gonna die

209
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,740
- in the first five minutes.
- Okay.

210
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,403
You don't need exotic flowers.
You can just get run-of-the-mill roses.

211
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,303
- For flowers?
- Yeah.

212
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,597
And if you want candles,
make sure you get tapers.

213
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,682
- Tapers?
- Yeah.

214
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,599
T-a-p...

215
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,643
You know what?
Why don't you let Judy and I do it?

216
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,019
What?

217
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,022
I mean, really?

218
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,899
Yeah. No, we would be happy to.

219
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,526
- Would we?
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,823
I'm just saying, they found the car, Jen.

221
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,366
I know. I heard him. I was there.

222
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,410
- They're dusting it for DNA.
- I know!

223
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,347
So I just don't think this is maybe
the smartest move we could be making.

224
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,411
It just came out of my mouth, okay?
I couldn't, like, shove it back in there.

225
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,626
I felt bad for him.

226
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,271
Did you see how overwhelmed he was?

227
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,339
I know. I did. I just...
Don't get me wrong,

228
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,984
- I think it's a sweet gesture.
- Thank you.

229
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,051
If you didn't kill the person
that the vigil is for.

230
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,135
Okay, well...

231
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,471
Ben shouldn't have to be doing it.

232
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,183
I mean, I had to plan Ted's funeral
two days after he died,

233
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,476
and it was fucking hell.

234
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,564
And not to sound like
how I'm probably gonna sound right now,

235
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,650
but maybe it's not the worst idea.

236
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,237
I mean, who's gonna suspect that
the people planning the vigil

237
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,841
are the reason that they're having
the vigil in the first place?

238
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,284
- Well, it's a type of logic.
- Okay, well, fine.

239
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,286
More importantly,
it's just a nice thing to do.

240
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,707
I mean, you of all people should get it.
It's like a total WWJD.

241
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,127
A "What would Judy do?"

242
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,338
Thanks.

243
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,841
I'm just trying to be a good person.

244
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,179
Okay.

245
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,473
Well, in that spirit...

246
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,850
I'm gonna say something,

247
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:47,396
and I would like you
to listen to it like I would.

248
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,066
- Okay.
- Okay.

249
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:56,072
Michelle's roommate is her ex-girlfriend.

250
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,031
No, fuck that.

251
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,199
- Dude.
- Sorry.

252
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,118
- It's Perez.
- Who's Perez?

253
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,953
- Her ex is Perez.
- Our Perez?

254
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,246
- That Perez.
- Oh, my God.

255
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,748
- I know.
- Oh, my God.

256
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,708
Of all the lesbians in Laguna...

257
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,629
I know, I didn't do it on purpose.
It just happened.

258
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,923
- Pretty organically, actually.
- Well, I'm sorry.

259
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,902
- Why are you sorry?
- Because that's what you would say

260
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,178
when I tell you that
you cannot see her anymore.

261
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,515
- Perez hates you.
- Okay, I think "hate" is a strong word.

262
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:26,644
Eh, no, that's the word that matches
the feeling that she has for you.

263
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,731
She served you with two restraining orders
in the last six months, Judy.

264
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,734
I can't have you fucking her girlfriend
on the other side of the wall!

265
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,403
- That's not their layout.
- Oh, Judy!

266
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,070
I really like Michelle.

267
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,913
She's the first person since Steve
that I can actually see myself with.

268
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,785
She makes me feel worthy.

269
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,370
I know. I'm sorry.

270
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,831
But you...

271
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,499
you just met her, you know?

272
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,670
And we really just have
to batten down our hatches right now.

273
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,505
I don't want to batten down my hatch.

274
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,465
Judy!

275
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,549
Please.

276
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,770
Hey.

277
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Hi.

278
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,650
Um, could we go somewhere?

279
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,484
Sure.

280
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,115
- Hi.
- Hi.

281
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,081
Oh.

282
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,208
We need to talk.

283
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,043
Yes, we should.

284
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,712
Um...

285
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,049
I'm sorry if my ex was a dick
to you this morning.

286
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,885
Oh, no, it's okay.

287
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,094
No.

288
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,514
No, no, no, it's not okay.
She can't treat you like that.

289
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,476
She's just overprotective.

290
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,271
She was, like,
trying to forbid me from seeing you.

291
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,107
Well, I don't think
I'm her cup of tea, so...

292
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,277
Yeah, I know.
She told me about the thing with the car.

293
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,488
What... what thing... with the... What car?

294
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,032
That you smashed up some car.

295
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,115
Oh.

296
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,161
And then she said that you were a riptide.

297
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,206
Hmm. Yeah.

298
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:15,669
Look, she doesn't get to decide
who I spend my time with.

299
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,295
I do.

300
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,922
And you do.

301
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,632
I do.

302
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,054
I just... I um, can't...

303
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,765
I can't keep spending time with you.

304
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,475
Oh.

305
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,895
Well, that took a turn.

306
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,899
You know, I don't...

307
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,778
I don't have a lot of nights
like the night we just had.

308
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,112
I don't either.

309
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,174
Okay, well, then if this is because
of something she said...

310
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,366
It's not. It's...

311
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,288
Your energy is so...

312
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,540
beautiful...

313
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,501
and honest.

314
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,794
And I...

315
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:03,884
I just feel karmically like I'm not
in the right place to receive it.

316
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,219
Okay.

317
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,809
Well, I mean, that just sounds
like a woo-woo way of saying,

318
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,227
"It's not you, it's me."

319
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,729
Well, it is me.

320
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,233
Trust me, you don't want anything
to do with me.

321
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,238
I'm sorry, I just can't see you anymore.

322
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,758
I mean, I'll probably see you
walking down the hallway

323
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,422
when you visit your mom, and I'll say hi,
but you know what I mean.

324
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Mm-hmm.

325
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:33,997
I'm sorry.

326
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,793
I'm sorry too.

327
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,757
I'm just gonna...

328
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,636
I'm just gonna wash my hands...

329
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,182
before returning to work,
'cause it's state law, so...

330
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,494
Hey.

331
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,415
What do you even wear to a vigil? Huh?

332
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,836
I think I'm going for somewhere in between
court appearance and second wedding.

333
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Sure.

334
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,964
Are you okay?

335
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,465
No.

336
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,929
- Did you talk to Michelle?
- Mm-hmm.

337
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,598
I'm so sorry you had to do that.

338
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,976
I see you're drinking your feelings.

339
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,520
- WWJD.
- Hmm?

340
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,606
"What would Jen do?"

341
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:41,899
Fair.

342
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,693
Hurtful, but fair.

343
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,613
What is all this?

344
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,533
Oh, uh,
we're helping Ben with his vigil thing.

345
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,285
Did they find his brother?

346
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,245
No. No, not yet.

347
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,122
Well, that sucks.

348
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,334
At least with Dad,
we knew right away, right?

349
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,795
Yeah, well, that's why we're doing it,
you know, just to...

350
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,673
show support, pay it forward.

351
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,510
Yeah, do good stuff,
make up for bad stuff, I got it.

352
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,178
Yep. All that.

353
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:14,932
I can't do this.

354
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,433
Oh, Jude.

355
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:20,562
I can't stand there with Steve's friends
and family and pray for his safe return.

356
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,482
I know... I understand, okay?

357
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:27,111
But don't you think it would be
a little weird if you didn't go?

358
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,362
They won't even notice.

359
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:32,116
The only time Steve's mom even remotely
cared about me was when I was pregnant.

360
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,785
I can't face her.

361
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,662
You don't have to, all right?

362
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,831
I will protect you. I promise.

363
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,001
All we have to do is show up,

364
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,919
hand out some candles,

365
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,505
and show the community we didn't do it.

366
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,133
Okay? And then we will
get the hell out of there.

367
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,051
Okay.

368
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,053
We will fly right under the radar.

Hi. Candle?

376
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,748
- Here you go.
- Candle?

377
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,831
Thank you.

378
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,084
- Candle?
- Hi, here's a candle.

379
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,585
Candle?

380
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,133
He has a lot more friends
than I thought he did.

381
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,965
- He's very social.
- Aww.

382
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,716
Here you go.

383
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,597
Take a look around.

384
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,306
What do you see?

385
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:43,520
Friends, neighbors, family
gathering to share one thing:

386
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:44,937
hope.

387
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,397
Thank you for coming.

388
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,734
Oh, hi, Len. Candle?

389
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,653
Len. Hi, Len. Like a candle?

390
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,115
Thank you.

391
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,579
- Yeah. I think we did a pretty good job.
- Yeah, are you kidding me?

392
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,082
Shit, I wanna go missing.

393
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,667
- Don't say that.
- Ah, you know what I mean.

394
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,881
- It's her.
- What?

395
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,674
It's his mom.

396
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,402
Okay, just don't... it's okay.

397
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,221
It's okay. Deep breath. Deep breath.
I got you. I got you.

398
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:18,847
Judy.

399
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,016
- Hello, Eileen.
- Hello, Judy.

400
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,227
You look the same. Bangs.

401
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,313
Yep. You look well.

402
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,396
I'm not.

403
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,650
Oh. I like your scarves.

404
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,236
Benji, find me a chair, would you?

405
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,319
Yes, Mom.

406
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,406
Benji told me
you helped put this together.

407
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,035
She did, because she is the kindest person
that I know.

408
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,246
Hey, will you go do that thing

409
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,581
that we talked about you doing
that I can't do...

410
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,305
- Sorry.
- ...because only you can?

411
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,503
Hi. I'm Jen. I'm, um...

412
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,505
I'm a friend of Ben's.

413
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,089
Would you like a candle?

414
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,717
I can't.
Strong smells trigger my migraines.

415
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,011
Oh, it's electric.

416
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,557
Oh, how novel. Thank you.

417
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,475
It's so kind of everyone to turn up.

418
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,229
I didn't have the strength
to plan this myself.

419
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,189
You understand.

420
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,481
Yeah, I do.

421
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,651
Do you have any children, Jen?

422
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,362
Uh, yeah, I... I have two boys.

423
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,282
Oh, just like me.

424
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,243
Yeah, like you.

425
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,957
Well, I pray you never have to
live through what I'm living through.

426
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,625
Thanks.

427
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,421
It's any mother's worst nightmare.

428
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,594
I'm so sorry.

429
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,976
Judy?

430
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,855
- Oh.
- What a surprise.

431
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,732
Howard! Hi.

432
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,443
Wow, that's a beautiful suit.

433
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,778
Made for me by hand in Mykonos.

434
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,113
How special.

435
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,908
I didn't think we'd see you here.

436
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,703
Oh. Well, I came
to support Steve's family, of course.

437
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,162
Hmm.

438
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,749
Is that why you ratted Steve out?

439
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,753
To support the family?

440
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,515
Oh, there he is.

441
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,226
I found you a comfortable seat, Mom.

442
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,518
Thank you, darling.

443
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,270
Pleasure meeting you, Jen.

444
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,188
Yes.

445
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,232
You hold your boys close.

446
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,441
I'll try.

447
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,990
She likes you.

448
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,470
Oh, hi.

449
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,430
- Hi.
- How are you holding up?

450
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:10,143
I mean, it's nice to see
so many people come out.

451
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,813
I just wish I...

452
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,566
I don't know. I wish had a better feeling
about the whole thing.

453
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,609
What...

454
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,320
What's your feeling?

455
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,530
He's my twin, Jude...

456
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,075
and if he was out there,
I feel like I would know.

457
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,577
- B-dubs!
- All about the Benjamins.

458
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,497
- What's up? Good to see you.
- Okay.

459
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,750
- Thank you, guys, for coming.
- Hundred percent.

460
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,253
Gotta have faith, man. He's out there.
Right, Judy?

461
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,671
A hundred percent.

462
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,507
Yeah, Steve's gonna turn up
even fucking better than before.

463
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,175
- Find us later for shots!
- Okay.

464
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,969
- Whoo!
- B-dubs!

465
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,656
God, he's always had the worst taste
in friends.

466
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,723
Right?

467
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,975
Better taste in women.

468
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,228
- I don't know about that.
- I do.

469
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,563
Hey, girl.

470
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,646
Hey, girl.

471
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,028
Sorry, girl.

472
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,195
Thanks, girl.

473
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,536
- Hey, girl.
- Hey, girl.

474
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,789
- I'm just finishing up with a client.
- Oh, okay.

475
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,658
Didn't expect to see you here.

476
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,268
Oh, hi.

477
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,437
Well, Ben's a client, so...

478
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,939
Didn't expect to see you here.

479
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,690
I'm working.

480
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,962
You'd be surprised how often
a perpetrator shows up

481
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,154
to something like this.

482
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,572
Really?

483
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,283
Like moths to a flame.

484
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Hey.

485
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,431
Heidi, right?

486
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,559
Yeah. Sorry, have we met?

487
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,396
Yeah. Once, in Steve's office.

488
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,857
Oh, right,
you're one of his clients, right?

489
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,526
Mm-hmm.

490
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,156
How far along are you?

491
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,909
Oh. Um...

492
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,911
Four months.

493
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,162
Wow.

494
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,706
Yeah.

495
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,251
Is it Steve's?

496
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,588
Um, yeah.

497
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,845
Sorry.

498
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,974
This is just, like, the hardest thing
I've ever been through.

499
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,859
Sorry.

500
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,363
No, no, no. No, don't be sorry.

501
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,325
I'm sorry.

502
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,788
You know what?

503
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,750
You got to keep hope alive, right?

504
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,543
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

505
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:23,878
Yeah.

506
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,716
Try to stay positive, okay?

507
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,511
Thank you.

508
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,483
Hey.

509
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:47,818
You okay?

510
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,404
That girl Steve was seeing...

511
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,156
- Yeah?
- ...is pregnant.

512
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,658
- No.
- Yeah.

513
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,368
Can we please go now?

514
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,537
Yes, I'm so sorry, Judy. I'm so sorry.

515
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,499
Yeah, let's just see if we can get out
of here this way.

516
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,416
Hi, Mom.

517
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,793
Charlie, what are you doing here?

518
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,505
I just thought I should come support Ben.

519
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Oh.

520
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,842
That's actually very sweet,
but we were, um...

521
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,677
- We were just leaving, so...
- We gotta go.

522
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:17,390
Hi. Thank you all for coming out
for Steve tonight.

523
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,410
- Let's try to sneak out.
- And a very special thank you

524
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,536
to Jen Harding and Judy Hale

525
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,104
for organizing this beautiful,
beautiful vigil.

526
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,316
Thank you, ladies.

527
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,152
- No problem.
- It's no big, no big at all.

528
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:34,074
So, starting today,
we have set up an anonymous tip line...

529
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,327
with a substantial reward.

530
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,664
Oh, they went with the reward.
I was afraid they wouldn't.

531
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,792
And it's substantial,
so that's good news for us.

532
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,544
- Yeah. It's great.
- So anyone

533
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,921
that has any information,
please come forward...

534
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,422
and help us...

535
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,384
help us bring my...

536
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,012
help us bring my brother home.

537
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:56,972
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

538
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,366
- I'll get some wine.
- All right.

539
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,390
Thank you.

Hi, stranger.

548
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,854
Pastor Wayne, hi.

549
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,356
Hey. You all right?

550
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,481
Uh...

551
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,279
I understand.

552
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,283
It's hard living with so much uncertainty.

553
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,536
But God is powerful.

554
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,288
He sees everything.

555
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,665
He sees Steve,

556
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,960
and sooner or later,
He'll bring the truth to light.

557
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,338
You just have to have faith.

558
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,135

Hey.

566
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,912
- Needed a break?
- Oh.

567
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,829
Yeah.

568
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,418
Me, too.

569
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,342
Thought you didn't drink.

570
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,677
Yeah, I don't.

571
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
I...

572
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,722
But I had to do shots for Steve, right?

573
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:05,891
Right.

574
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,567
I'm so sorry.

575
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:22,158
Why are you sorry? You don't need
to be sorry. You're, like...

576
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,907
You're, like, the only good part
of this whole thing.

577
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,624
You don't know me that well.

578
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,797
Well, I know you went out of your way
to help me.

579
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,383
That's more than anyone else here's done.

580
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,970
I know you're a good person.

581
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,640
I know you're a good mom.

582
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,479
That's really nice of you to say.

583
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,563
It's true.

584
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,572
If there's a silver lining in all this...

585
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,992
it's meeting you.

586
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,870
Same.

587
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,293
I just...

588
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,211
It's getting a little cold.

589
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,547
I should probably get going.

590
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,467
Oh, no, please,
you don't have to give me...

591
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,550
I insist.

592
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,013
Thank you.

593
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,394
What?

594
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,380
- Long time no see.
- Shit.

595
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,967
Yeah, well, you're not gonna see me
anymore, because I told Michelle that

596
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,271
I'm not gonna hang out with her anymore
because I respect boundaries.

597
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,473
Do you? Because from what I've seen,

598
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,850
you always seem
to be everywhere you shouldn't be.

599
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,494
Well, maybe that's just how you see it.

600
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,562
- It is. That's what I just said.
- Well, yeah, so?

601
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,900
Miss Hale, I've had two major cases
in the last six months,

602
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,110
and there is one person
at the epicenter of them both.

603
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,070
Is it me?

604
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,404
Yes.

605
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,162
I'm warning you, watch yourself,
because I sure as hell am.

606
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,958
Well, you know what? Good.

607
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,753
Go ahead and watch me,
because all you're gonna see

608
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,632
is a good fucking person trying to do
the right fucking thing all the time.

609
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,944
Maybe I shouldn't,
maybe that's where I go wrong,

610
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,513
but I can't help myself because it's
in my stupid fucking nature!

611
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,034
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go pick up those paper bags

612
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,538
because I don't want a seal to choke!
