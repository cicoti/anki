1
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,024
Ooh, God, I gotta pee.

2
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,442
Then stop drinking so much water.

3
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,986
Because I have so much dust
in my throat.

4
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,739
- Well, then, drink some water.
- Okay.

5
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,323
Oh, no.

6
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,117
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What?

7
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,410
Is my phone in my bag?

8
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,493
- What?
- My phone.

9
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,830
Can you look in my bag
and see if my phone is there?

10
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,041
No, I don't see it.

11
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,126
Oh, fuck, fuck, fucking fuck!

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,712
I think I might have left it back there.

13
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,088
- What?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,631
You wouldn't do that. Why would you?

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,317
- I don't know.
- You must have it somewhere.

16
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,341
I don't. I fucking don't, Judy.
We have to go back.

17
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,065
Oh, my God, what if I left it in the hole?

18
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,597
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, my God.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,575
- Wait, I'll call it.
- No, don't fucking call it!

20
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,868
- Why not?
- Are you fucking insane?

21
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,310
- Why?
- If it rings in the hole,

22
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,561
it's like a megaphone saying,

23
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,414
"Hey everybody,
there's a fucking body in here!"

24
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,374
- You're right, that's insane.
- This is a disaster.

25
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,026
This is a fucking disaster! This is a...
Oh, here it is.

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,986
We're fine.

27
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,737
Fine.

28
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,455
Oh, my God, is that for us?

29
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,372
Is it?

30
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,125
How could it not be? It's right behind us.

31
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,628
I know. Um...

32
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,005
I hate to say this, but we are

33
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,175
two middle-aged white women
in a Mercedes.

34
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,636
I know, and I appreciate you
acknowledging your privilege,

35
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,179
but we also just buried a body.

36
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,680
Which nobody knows about.

37
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,075
<i>Pull over.</i>

38
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,141
Shit.

39
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,477
We have shovels in the car.

40
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:43,937
We were gardening.

41
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,271
Oh, God, in the forest?

42
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,273
How do you think
forest people get their food?

43
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,776
Well, what, were we planting fruit trees
in the forest?

44
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,194
Berries for foraging. Foraging!

45
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,987
Say we were planting berries for foraging.

46
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,281
We're berry planters. Got it. Oh, God.

47
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,635
- What kind of berries?
- I don't know. Raspberries?

48
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,452
It's not raspberry season.

49
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,038
- Forget it, okay? Just don't say a word.
- Okay.

50
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,125
- Don't say anything, Judy.
- Okay, I won't.

51
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,126
Maybe I should just gun it.

52
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,609
- You can't gun it.
- No, I think...

53
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,049
- Hi.
- How are you?

54
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,218
Was it worth it?

55
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,097
- What?
- What was? Was what?

56
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,099
You committed a crime.

57
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,477
N-no.

58
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,187
You're driving.

59
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,126
As soon as that phone is in your hand,
you're committing a crime.

60
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,446
Oh.

61
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,508
- I didn't know that.
- What was so important

62
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,972
you had to look at it while driving?

63
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,369
- GPS.
- The...

64
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,662
- Yeah, the maps.
- Yeah.

65
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,580
I couldn't...

66
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,915
You don't need the GPS.
I can tell you where you are.

67
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,250
Up shit's creek.

68
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,841
I'm just messing with you.

69
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,204
You're getting a ticket, though.

70
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,095
Oh.

71
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,723
- You should've seen your face.
- A ticket.

72
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,367
- Silly Willy McGilly.
- License and registration.

73
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,685
Yep, yep.

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,110
You really can't wait till a hotel?

75
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,613
I've been holding it in for six hours.

76
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,002
Excuse me. Um...

77
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,714
Uh, what... what kind of pie is that one?

78
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,840
Cherry.

79
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,884
Is it, um... is it good?

80
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,052
It's cherry.

81
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,015
Well, cherry can be shitty,
but what about that? What's...

82
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,308
Cherry.

83
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,685
Oh, okay.
I guess I'm gonna have the cherry.

84
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,567
I can't fucking believe we got a ticket.
Now there's record we were here.

85
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,026
Fucking Shandy.

86
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,445
This pie is really dry.

87
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,821
- You want some?
- No.

88
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,242
Oh, man.

89
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,369
It's just like, everything hurts.

90
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,122
It feels like my spine is trying
to claw its way out of my back.

91
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,293
You sure you're not hungry
or anything? They have waffles.

92
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,377
I'm not hungry.

93
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,298
Look...

94
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,804
I feel bad that we couldn't attend

95
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,932
to the more spiritual tidbits
that you wanted

96
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,601
to include in what we just did, but...

97
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,521
we couldn't risk getting caught, Judy.

98
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,773
I mean, we really had
to get in and out, right?

99
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,024
I mean, yeah, right.

100
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,655
But it took a really long time.
It's not like we just got in and got out.

101
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,215
- Right, we had to...
- Refill?

102
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,990
Yes, please. Thank you, Marva.

103
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,285
Marva, could I get
some whipped cream for this?

104
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,704
It's a little dry. Thank you.

105
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,542
Look, all I'm saying is that
we just didn't have time to, like,

106
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,835
dilly-dally.

107
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,546
- I wasn't trying to dilly-dally.
- You know what I mean.

108
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,674
I just wanted to sing a song for Steve
or maybe say a few things.

109
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,591
I know.

110
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,511
But we didn't know who was out there
or who could hear us.

111
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,430
Okay, so I'm sorry if I got a little rigid

112
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,765
'cause we couldn't stop
to sing "Halle-fucking-lujah."

113
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,516
Just so you know...

114
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,977
Thank you.

115
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,855
I wasn't gonna sing that song.

116
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,106
I know it's played out.

117
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,189
I just wanted to give...

118
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,027
give the moment a sense of occasion.

119
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,611
This is what I'm saying, Judy.

120
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,155
Not everything is a fucking, like,

121
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,616
Disney-movie's-about-to-start fucking
castles with fucking sparkle time, okay?

122
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,369
We are not in <i>Snow White</i> here.

123
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,079
We are in fucking <i>Scarface.</i>

124
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,456
Well, I've never seen that.

125
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,207
Neither have I. No girls have.

126
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,417
But we know what it's about.

127
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,006
Really?

128
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,216
She did that on purpose.

129
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,430
Shouldn't we have stopped
someplace less fancy?

130
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,806
It's just a shower pit stop.

131
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,893
I know, but I didn't have time to
Trufflepig my way through Priceline, okay?

132
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,853
I just...
I can't handle this level of dirty.

133
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,216
I feel like a frat house toilet.

134
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,940
You think we're gonna get a room?
It's so last-minute.

135
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,668
It's the middle of nowhere.
No one stays here.

136
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,652
I'm sorry,
we don't have anything available.

137
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,570
What's that now?

138
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,281
We have a wedding this weekend,
so we're all booked up. I'm sorry.

139
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,867
Okay, you literally don't have anything?

140
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,244
Hmm.

141
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,831
Yeah, thought so.

142
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,806
Oh! Actually, I can offer you
our presidential suite.

143
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,325
It's a two-night minimum, but the rate...

144
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,059
I don't want to know. We'll take it.

145
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,520
I got this, okay? My treat.

146
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,359
Are you ladies in town
for business or pleasure?

147
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,398
- Pleasure.
- Business.

148
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,899
- Business.
- Pleasure.

149
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,071
No, it's just a gals' weekend
with my best friend.

150
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,531
My befri.

151
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,198
Right?

152
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,491
Yeah.

153
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,955
Who the fuck gets married
in Antelope Valley?

154
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,683
People from Antelope Valley?

155
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,708
Oh, I guess.

156
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,668
- Jen.
- Jeff.

157
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,585
- Hey.
- Hi.

158
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,670
- Hi.
- Hi, Jeff.

159
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,587
Hello, Jen.

160
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,216
Judy, this is...
You know my neighbor Karen?

161
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,093
- Yeah.
- Yeah, this is her husband Jeff.

162
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,470
- Oh, wow, Karen is so nice.
- Yeah. So hi.

163
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,656
- Yeah, she's great.
- Is she here?

164
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,891
- Uh, no, no, no.
- Bummer, bummer, bummer. Okay, all right.

165
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,227
Yeah, it's just a business trip, so...

166
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,746
- Great.
- You here for the wedding?

167
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,106
- No, we're having a girls' weekend.
- Oh, fun.

168
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,233
- I got our coffees, babe.
- Oh.

169
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,278
- "Babe."
- Thank you.

170
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,655
Jen, listen, could you...

171
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,658
- ...maybe not...
- Yep. All good. Mm-hmm.

172
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,033
- Okay.
- Yep. Nope.

173
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,577
The only reason that I even put...

174
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,140
- We were never here.
- Sure.

175
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,205
- It doesn't have to go that far.
- Okay, bye-bye.

176
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,667
Thank you, I just... thank... oh, fuck.

177
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,005
Oh, my God.

178
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,799
I can't believe we did that.

179
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,563
We still have to deal with his car, but...

180
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,387
I think that...

181
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,599
I feel like we might be okay.

182
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,183
I guess so.

183
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,146
- Do you want to take a shower first?
- No.

184
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,066
Want to get out
of those dirty clothes or...

185
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,488
do you just want to stare
out the window weirdly?

186
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,489
Yeah.

187
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,534
Okay.

188
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,999
<i>Hey. Is there power?</i>

189
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,876
Yeah, it just came back on.

190
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,210
Oh, well, that's good.

191
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,839
Well, not fucking really. Now Henry,
Christopher, and Henry's weird friend

192
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,925
are dancing around
to <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

193
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,968
Okay, you know what? Language, Charlie.

194
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,198
Don't denigrate <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>
It's a great fucking show.

195
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,474
Whatever. I don't even know
why Christopher's here.

196
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,328
We would've been fine on our own.
Now they're driving me fucking crazy.

197
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,312
You know what?
Why don't you go out for a walk

198
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,106
and say "fuck" outside instead
of sitting there, moping around?

199
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,275
<i>It's 100 degrees out.
I can't walk anywhere.</i>

200
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,735
This is why I need a car.

201
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,154
With climate change,
it's only getting more urgent.

202
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,078
Oh, wow, well, thank you
for mansplaining to me

203
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,242
why you are the most affected
by climate change.

204
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,119
<i>Charlie, you're going to get a car
soon enough.</i>

205
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,372
But for now, like I said,

206
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,790
you're getting Dad's bike.

207
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,250
Well, when is that gonna happen?

208
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,335
Uh, when I have time to go
to the storage unit,

209
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,587
<i>- which is a whole thing.
- </i>Whatever.

210
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,631
Look, we, um...

211
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,008
...we'll be back tomorrow
from Judy's sick aunt's place.

212
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,010
She was kind of touch-and-go here,

213
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,388
- but I think she's gonna pull through.
<i>- Great.</i>

214
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,682
Okay, well, love you. Bye.

215
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,101
<i>Wait, did you say you loved me enough
to buy me a car?</i>

216
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,728
No, I said I love you. Bye.

217
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,988
Hey, I just need to plug in my phone.
It's dying already.

218
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,371
So, how are we?

219
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,124
We're okay.

220
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,795
Okay, yeah.

221
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,089
I know...

222
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,925
last night was a lot, but I...

223
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,095
I just feel like we're
on the other side of it, Jude.

224
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,476
Is there, um, anything

225
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,646
I can get you or, just, like...

226
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,192
Want me to get you a spa service,
like a nice massage or something?

227
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,238
Oh, look at that.
TripAdvisor gives it almost three stars.

228
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,554
Don't know why you would print that.

229
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,617
No, thank you.

230
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,201
You want a mani-pedi? No?

231
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,747
I'm not really in the mood.
Sorry if that's bothering you.

232
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,291
Jesus, Judy.
You're not bothering me. Okay?

233
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,086
Are you mad at me?

234
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,547
Because it's okay to be mad at me.

235
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,722
No, I'm not.

236
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,746
Okay, well, can you please
just tell me what to do here?

237
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,856
Because you're the nice one
and I'm the shitty one,

238
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,902
so just tell me how I can do
something nice for you.

239
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,572
Because you're scaring me a little.

240
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,243
I just don't really feel
like talking right now.

241
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,746
Okay.

242
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,418
I think I'm just really tired

243
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,588
from six hours of digging a hole
in the forest

244
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,257
that ended with dumping my ex-fiancé
in that hole.

245
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,678
Yeah, okay.

246
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,890
Yeah, sure.

247
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,157
Hey. Hey.

248
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,783
You up?

249
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,161
I am now.

250
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,414
What's going on?

251
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,960
Um, I, uh, have an idea.

252
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,085
There's, uh...

253
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:56,006
There's a bar down in the lobby called
Whispers and Winks,

254
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,883
and I just thought maybe...

255
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,386
we could go down and...

256
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,471
do a toast to...

257
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,431
to Steve.

258
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,933
Really?

259
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:11,021
Yeah. I mean, isn't that what people do
after a burial?

260
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,230
Right?

261
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,567
Commiserate, drink...

262
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,776
Let it all out.

263
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,868
- Okay.
- Yeah?

264
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,830
Did you say "Whiskers and Wings"?

265
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,124
No, why would it be "Whiskers"?
No, it's "Whispers."

266
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,043
- Oh.
- And "Winks," like psst! Psst! Psst!

267
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,298
I am gonna need you to shower, though.

268
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,967
- 'Cause...
- Yeah?

269
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,803
Just 'cause...

270
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,721
I stink?

271
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,474
Mm, you just...
You just look dumb in those clothes.

272
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,557
They're yours.

273
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,895
Hi.

274
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:51,979
Hi. What can I get you?

275
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,441
Uh, we'll get two double scotches. Okay.

276
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,502
If you're with the wedding party,
it's open bar.

277
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,526
Oh, we're actually...

278
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,031
The bride is my second cousin, so, yeah,
we'll just get the Johnnie Walker Blue.

279
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,698
Thank you.

280
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,287
- It's pretty loud.
- It's a bar.

281
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,498
Thank you.

282
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,581
Thank you.

283
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,919
To Steve.

284
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,255
To Steve.

285
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,594
Um...

286
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,181
Do you want to say something about him?

287
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,100
This isn't really what I was imagining,
so I don't...

288
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,101
Okay.

289
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,603
I don't really know what to say.

290
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,855
Well, um...

291
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,068
He was very good-looking.

292
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,571
- He was more than that.
- Right, of course.

293
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,657
- You didn't really know him.
- No, I didn't.

294
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,076
He was very thoughtful...

295
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,993
and sweet.

296
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,996
- Okay.
- He was.

297
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,914
Okay.

298
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,125
He used to always do these little things
for me to make me feel special.

299
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,209
Aww.

300
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,420
Even the way he proposed.

301
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,339
Yeah? What, um...

302
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,341
How did he propose?

303
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,677
- With a flash mob.
- Oh.

304
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,846
Aw, that's... that's so fun.

305
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,949
I thought we were just going to the beach
for the day,

306
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,934
but then 200 people jumped up...

307
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,688
and did this whole choreographed thing
to Cyndi Lauper.

308
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,857
That's very thoughtful.

309
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,027
He really had a soft side
that he didn't show a lot of people.

310
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,155
Mm-hmm. Okay.

311
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,032
I know you didn't like him.

312
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,910
You have every reason not to.

313
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,872
I know who he was.

314
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,873
I get it.

315
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,502
But I loved him.

316
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,215
He was the first person who ever...

317
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,135
really made me feel loved.

318
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,139
He wasn't always perfect.

319
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,726
But he was my person.

320
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,894
No, I know.

321
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,562
No, I...

322
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,064
I know what you mean.

323
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,027
Hmm.

324
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,652
What?

325
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,156
- What?
- No...

326
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,630
There's this thing I always wanted
to tell you, and I just never...

327
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,203
never felt like it was the right time.

328
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,539
- What?
- I don't know, just forget it.

329
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,542
No, you can't tell me you have something
to tell me and then not tell me.

330
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,520
- Yeah, I hate when people do that.
- It's annoying.

331
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,584
- It is.
- So just tell me.

332
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,629
Okay.

333
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,634
The morning after we...

334
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,676
hit Ted...

335
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,930
I woke up, and...

336
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,934
Steve wasn't in bed,
so I went looking around for him...

337
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,479
and I found him at our favorite spot
by the beach.

338
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,983
And he was just sitting on the wet sand.

339
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,779
He was crying like a little kid.

340
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,743
It's not that he didn't care
about what happened.

341
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,748
He was gutted by it, but I just don't
think that he was able to...

342
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,292
...show his feelings, you know?

343
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,086
Mm-hmm.

344
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,463
But I think he felt safe at the beach,

345
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,706
and that's why I kind of wanted us
to take him there...

346
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,510
and put him to rest.

347
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,261
Yeah, I get it.

348
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,641
I just wanted...

349
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,110
I just...

350
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,572
I just wanted to say goodbye to him.

351
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,410
He always took such good care of me.

352
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,954
I just wanted to do something for him,
too.

353
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,547
What's wrong? Are you okay?

354
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,385
I'm sorry.

355
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,262
I'm so sorry.

356
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,973
You deserve to say goodbye.

357
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,101
I got to do it with Ted, and...

358
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,936
Just, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

359
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,563
- No, no, no.
- It's not fair.

360
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,166
- Don't cry. I don't want you to feel bad.
- You don't have to take care of me.

361
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,501
- I'm sorry.
- Don't take care of me.

362
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,652
I can do whatever I want.

363
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,075
It's why Steve loved you.

364
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,411
Because you are...

365
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,332
...you are, like, the kindest person maybe
in the whole fucking world.

366
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,379
I love you so much.

367
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,505
I really do.

368
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,259
I love you so much.

369
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,390
Will you be my person?

370
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,935
Yes. I'll be your person.

371
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,148
- Hey, there.
- Oh.

372
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,152
Do you guys want to dance?

373
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,613
- Oh! No, thank you.
- What the...

374
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,532
- You sure?
- Oh, my God, excuse me.

375
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,826
Do you see that we're
in the middle of something here?

376
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,329
Does it look like my friend wants
to fucking dance?

377
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,581
Read the room, fucko.

378
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,836
What in the hell is fucking wrong
with people?

379
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,297
Seriously!

380
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,759
- Oh!
- Poor guy, he just wanted to dance.

381
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,842
My God.

382
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,972
"Those girls look like
they might kill themselves.

383
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,726
Maybe they want to get a nice jig in
before they jump off the bridge."

384
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,645
What an asshole.

385
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,063
He really is.

386
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,146
Oh, God.

387
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,150
I do actually kind of feel like dancing.

388
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,318
- What?
- I don't know.

389
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,737
- With that guy?
- No, no. With you.

390
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,364
With me. Okay.

391
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,948
Okay.

392
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,827

Oh, my God, poor Karen!

00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,398

are business partners?

415
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,948
- Judy.
- What?

416
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:00,949
Judy.

417
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,035
- No?
- Those guys are joined at the dick.

418
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,455
- Aww! To Karen.
- Oh, to Karen!

419
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,878
- Whoo! Can we have two more, please?
- Um... yes.

420
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,939
Yeah, I know you're not
with the wedding party.

421
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:15,839
- Excuse me?
- What?

422
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,424
You owe me $83.

423
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,050
What?

424
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,803
Douche.

425
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,388
And get the fuck out.

426
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,893
Psst, psst, psst.

427
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,447
Oh! Oh.

428
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,368
Oh, Christ...

429
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,581
Hello.

430
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,169
Wait, wait, wait. What?

431
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,840
Oh, shit.

432
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,760
Are we sure that it's <i>the</i> bird?

433
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,678
That it's our bird?

434
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,971
Henry is sure.

435
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,390
What happened?

436
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,600
Everyone was having a fun time.

437
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,104
Then I stepped in here for two minutes
to make lemon ricotta pancakes,

438
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,480
and as I was grating the zest,

439
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:17,234
I heard a scream, and I was too late.
The bird was already dead.

440
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,568
Okay, but how?

441
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,111
Um...

442
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,655
The dog did it.

443
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,574
Probably just animal instinct.

444
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,909
- I am so sorry, Jen.
- Oh, God.

445
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,370
I told Alan she needed
to be professionally trained.

446
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,415
But you know what? This is not like her.
Adele is not aggressive.

447
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,916
I mean, she is a snob.

448
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,751
She won't wear synthetics.

449
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,145
It's okay. It's okay.

450
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,046
It's okay, baby. It's okay to be sad.

451
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,257
I just...

452
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:44,094
I just wish I knew it was the last time
I was gonna play with the bird.

453
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,388
I would have said goodbye.

454
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,810
You can still say goodbye.

455
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,943
In your hands, O Lord,

456
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,614
we humbly entrust our brothers, sisters,

457
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,115
and birds.

458
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,370
In this life, you embrace them
with your tender love.

459
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,582
So now, deliver them from evil

460
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,375
and bid them eternal rest.

461
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,962
Let us find in you comfort in our sadness

462
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:23,050
and the courage
to move through this together.

463
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,886
Amen.

464
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,452
Judy, would you mind singing something?

465
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,104
Yeah, would you?

466
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,648

Hi.

487
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,317
We're so sorry to bother you.

488
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,086
Oh, it's all right.

489
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,110
Hi, Shandy.

490
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,030
I hope we didn't wake you
from your slumbers.

491
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:53,158
No, it's eight o'clock.
I wasn't slumbering.

492
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,076
Shandy has something to say.

493
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,786
Don't you?

494
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,706
It's regarding the bird.

495
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,125
Okay.

496
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,459
I killed it.

497
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,212
Oh, you did.

498
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,255
I was trying to stop it from flying away.

499
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,674
But I guess I squeezed it too hard.

500
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,010
I didn't realize birds were mostly liquid.

501
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,513
- Hmm.
- But it was an accident.

502
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,472
Right?

503
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,726
Yes.

504
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,313
- I'm sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

505
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,274
- Okay.
- I'm so sorry.

506
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:31,154
I really appreciate how much
you've been letting Shandy come over.

507
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,658
I hope this doesn't change anything.

508
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,202
She needs friends.

509
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,662
Mm-hmm.

510
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,498
Okay.

511
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:46,044
Uh, let's let Jen get back to her evening.

512
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:47,753
Thanks.

513
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,635
I just...
I wish I didn't have to tell Henry.

514
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,013
He's my best friend,
and I don't want to lose him.

515
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,225
You know what?

516
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,770
You don't have to tell him.

517
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:07,023
- Really?
- Yeah. It's okay.

518
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,486
I think sometimes people need a friend

519
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,154
more than they need the truth.

520
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,324
