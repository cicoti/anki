1 
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,681
So, you just heat it up at 300
and leave it in for 35 minutes.

2
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:17,308
Thanks, Karen.
But you really don't have to keep...

3
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,084
- It's my take on Mexican lasagna.
- Great.

4
00:00:20,256 --> 00:00:22,939
It's nothing. We just don't want you
to think you're alone.

5
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,131
- Mmm.
- Jeff and I are here for you,

6
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:26,735
if you ever wanna talk.

7
00:00:26,974 --> 00:00:27,982
Thanks.

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,447
Just can't imagine
what you're going through.

9
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:35,827
Well, it's like if Jeff got hit by a car
and died suddenly and violently.

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,036
Like that.

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,665
Right.

12
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,019
Well, you get that dish back to me
whenever you can...

13
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:44,268
Yup. Gonna get right on it.

14

15
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,151
Oh.

16
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,237
Fuck.

17
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,154
God.

18
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,369
I'd skip the coffee. It's terrible.

19
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,954
I made it.

20
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,498
Hmm? Oh.

21
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,124
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,919
- No. I'm just kidding.
- Hmm?

23
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,882
- I'm just kidding.
- Oh.

24
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,048
I'm Judy.

25
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,091
- Hi. Jen.
- Hi.

26
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:17,453
Hi.

27
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,764
You come to this group often?

28
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,642
Uh... No. This is my first time here.

29
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,185
- Me, too.
- Oh.

30
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,191
Sorry. I hope this isn't weird.

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Do you do real estate?

32
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,532
I feel like I've seen your face
on, like, a... a bus bench?

33
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,825
You and a cute gay guy?

34
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,034
- Yeah.
- What?

35
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,036
Yeah, that's me.

36
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,707
With Christopher, who does not think
he looks gay in that picture.

37
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,169
I didn't mean that in a bad way.
I think gay is beautiful.

38
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:50,521
Which bench did you see?

39
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,506
Oh, I think it's the one
where you're like...

40
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,843
Oh, no.

41
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,803
No? And he's like...

42
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,556
No, no, no.
I guess I just mean where do you live?

43
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:03,540
Oh, my gosh.

44
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,058
Sorry. Newport Beach.

45
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,097
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:08,771
- You live... You live in Newport?
- Yeah.

47
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:10,391
Okay.

48
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,318
Yeah. I don't think I
belong there either.

49
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:16,412
- Not a bad thing to not belong there.
- Right.

50
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:20,200
But if you ever need
a real estate agent, just...

51
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,160
- Oh, wow. Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

52
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,745
- I might.
- Okay.

53
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,750
Sorry.

54
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,418
I hope this isn't weird.

55
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,046
Can I give you a hug?

56
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,965
No.

57
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:38,718
Okay.

58
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,054
Well, looks like we have
some new people here today.

59
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,889
Hi. I'm Judy.

60
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,807
- Hi, Judy.
- Hey, Judy.

61
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:49,953
- Uh-uh. That's okay.
- All right.

62
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,024
Well, welcome to Friends of Heaven.
I'm Pastor Wayne.

63
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,652
As some of you know,
I like to start out our grief circle

64
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,529
by talking about a loss I lived through
that got me into this work.

65
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,644
My aunt fell down a flight of stairs

66
00:04:01,678 --> 00:04:03,250
and cracked her head open and bled out

67
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,203
as her five-year-old son watched,

68
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,966
and I was the one that asked her
to get me a soda from the basement.

69
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,166
So, I live with that.

70
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,669
And that's a little something about me.

71
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,462
Oh, my God.

72
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,506
I appreciate that.

73
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,550
Is there a loss you've had
that you'd like to share with us today?

74
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,302
Uh...

75
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,431
Yeah. I lost my fiance eight weeks ago.

76
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,977
Um... It was really sudden.

77
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,438
One minute, we were eating dinner
and then the next, he was gone.

78
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,191
I'm so sorry.

79
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:37,902
Thank you.

80
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,949
- Heart attack?
- Yeah. He was 44.

81
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,202
Oh, that sucks. Sorry.

82
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,452
Thank you.

83
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,248
Thank you for sharing that.

84
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,959
So, last week, we started
talking about...

85
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,918
the F-word.

86
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,630
Forgiveness.

87
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,444
Forgiveness can be very difficult,

88
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:02,960
and it can take time, even a lifetime.

89
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,566
But no matter what the circumstances,

90
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,233
everyone is deserving of forgiveness.

91
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,891
You really think that?

92
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,459
Jesus thought that.

93
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:11,717
Amen.

94
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,646
Um, excuse me. Um...

95
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,700
How do you forgive someone
who hits your husband with their car,

96
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,233
and then drives away, leaving him to

97
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,311
bleed to death on the side of the road?

98
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,362
How do you forgive that?

99
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,371
No, that's it.

100
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,624
Don't really wanna get into it,
so someone else can go.

101
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,960
At your own pace.

102
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,839
It's okay to feel whatever you're
feeling, sad, angry, defensive...

103
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,008
I'm not defensive. Okay?

104
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,345
I'm tired.

105
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,722
I'm tired, too.

106
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,103
Can you tell us more about that?

107
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,519
Oh, yeah. I just haven't been sleeping.

108
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,316
You know, I've never been
a very good sleeper, anyway, but...

109
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,861
since Ted died, not at all.

110
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,949
I mean, not naturally, anyway, but...

111
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,575
And I'm not gonna take pills.

112
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:12,789
I was not a pill person
and I have two kids, two boys, who...

113
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,667
who need me, and so,
I'm not gonna be one of those, like,

114
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:21,005
Xanax Ambien zombie moms, you know.

115
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,139
Hey. Hey!

116
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,515
Oh, hey.

117
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:33,975
Uh...

118
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,311
I'm up all night.

119
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,942
Feel free to call me.
We can... not sleep together.

120
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,827
It's supposed to be Mexican lasagna.

121
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,829
Why are there raisins in this?

122
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,331
- I honestly don't know.
- I like it.

123
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,918
- I'm sick of other people's food.
- Me, too.

124
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,423
And I miss Dad's cooking.

125
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:05,502
Me, too.

126
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,219
It's just so not fair.

127
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,721
Like, why did our dad have to die?
Why didn't...

128
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,516
Tyler's dad die? Rick.
That guy's a twatwaffle.

129
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,767
I like Rick.

130
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,440
- You have to wait till I'm asleep.
- Mm-hmm.

131
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:21,574
All the way asleep.

132
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,192
I know, Boop.

133
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,029
- Mommy?
- Yup?

134
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,657
- I don't wanna go to school tomorrow.
- No kidding.

135
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,117
I wanna go to work with you.

136
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,538
Oh, sweetie, I know, but we just can't
do that anymore, okay?

137
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,166
I mean, it's been three months, and...

138
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,918
I think it's just time for us
to go back to normal.

139
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,588
- But I wanna be with you.
- I know.

140
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,506
I know, baby.

141
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,303
You know, what happened
to your dad was an accident.

142
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,346
- As far as we know.
- Charlie, please.

143
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,768
What happened to your dad
was a freak accident.

144
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,646
And nothing like that
is gonna happen to me, okay?

145
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,023
I promise you.

146
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,566
No, it's not that.

147
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,905
I'm not worried
something's gonna happen to you.

148
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,985
No?

149
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,030
Well, then what are you worried about?

150
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,074
I just don't want you to be alone.

151
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:51,988
Okay.

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,002
Hello?

153
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,629
Uh... Judy?

154
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,758
- Yeah?
- It's... It's Jen from...

155
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,427
from the grief group thing.

156
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,761
Hi.

157
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,765
I'm sorry. I don't... I don't even know
why I'm calling you.

158
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,560
No, no. God, come on.
I told you you could.

159
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,104
- Is it too late?
- No.

160
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,816
- Are you in bed?
- Uh, yeah.

161
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,736
- What are you wearing?
- Huh?

162
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,280
What are you wearing?

163
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,490
Um...

164
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:39,469
A pair of my husband's sweatpants

165
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:43,207
and a T-shirt he got
for running a 5K for...

166
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,293
psoriasis.

167
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,419
Mm. Slower.

168
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,462
You're a weird person, Judy.

169
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,712
Thank you.

170
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:56,429
Did your husband really like running?
Or did he just hate psoriasis?

171
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,351
I'm sorry. You don't have to talk
about him if you don't want to.

172
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,354
Uh, no, no. He... He liked running.

173
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,817
Came to it later in life. He was 40.

174
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,113
- What made him start?
- He was gettin' doughy.

175
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,656
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,867
Men get that middle-aged man puff.

177
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,953
Yeah. I mean, he had a
full-on beer belly.

178
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,503
He was getting a beer neck.

179
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,123
Beer neck?

180
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,459
So, he started running.

181
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,210
I was proud of him.

182
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,421
He was in the best shape
of his life, when...

183
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,174
when the car hit him.

184
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,469
I'm so sorry.

185
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,762
Yeah.

186
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,146
Are you... Are you eating something?

187
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,605
Mm-hmm.

188
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,610
It's an Entenmann's chocolate chip
cookie. You know, the little one?

189
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,447
Why, yes, I do.

190
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,199
Oh, he was...

191
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,269
He was always a really good musician,

192
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:02,058
even then.

193
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,664
He was the only guy
I knew who liked Ani DiFranco.

194
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,956
Oh, I love Ani.

195
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,919
Well, I haven't talked about
him much since he died.

196
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,090
- Well, we can stop. I don't wanna pry.
- No. It's...

197
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:16,242
It's nice.

198
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,927
Did you get it?

199
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:21,171
- Is that him?
- No, that's my other husband.

200
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:23,210
Oh, you have another one?
Then you're fine.

201
00:11:23,244 --> 00:11:26,060
Yeah, but if something happens
to him, then...

202
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:32,024
- Excuse me.
- I heard that.

203
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,318
You should ride that
wave and go to sleep.

204
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:35,793
No, I want a picture of Steve.

205
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:37,822
I'd have to look.

206
00:11:38,835 --> 00:11:39,848
Found some.

207
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:41,489
Jeez. Okay.

208
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:43,993
Hold on.

209
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,748
Oh, my God.

210
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,084
- Is that your house?
- Yeah.

211
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,376
Harbor Ridge?

212
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,088
- Yup.
- It's a lovely home.

213
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,217
He was very handsome.

214
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,969
Thanks.

215
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,265
Yeah, I always thought he had
kind of a JFK Jr. vibe.

216
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,348
God!

217
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,810
JFK Jr. was so hot.

218
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:10,953
- So hot.
- And then just so sad.

219
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:12,446
So sad.

220
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:15,143
So fucked up.

221
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,820
- You're tired.
- Oh, yeah.

222
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,257
I think I am. You're not?

223
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,659
No. But... I'll let you go.

224
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,910
No, no, no. No.

225
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,374
Would you...

226
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,130
Would you mind waiting
until I fall asleep?

227
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,048
Uh...

228
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,592
Okay.

229
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:41,852
I mean, like...

230
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,221
...all the way asleep?

231
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,350
Sure, of course.

232
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,060
Thank you.

233
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,814
All right.

234
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,419
- Do you want me to keep talking?
- No, 'cause then I can't fall asleep.

235
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,494
Oh. Okay. Right.

236
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,435
Okay?

237
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,066
Hey.

238
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,027
Oh, Judy.

239
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,757
Psst!

240
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,227
I mean, if I knew it
was the end, I would...

241
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:13,594
...start smoking immediately.

242
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,979
Oh, my God. Yes.

243
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,313
- Right?
- Immediately.

244
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,482
Smoking is the greatest thing
that slowly kills you.

245
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:20,157
It's the greatest.

246
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:21,369
- I would.
- Ooh!

247
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,204
- But I need something...
- Facts of Life is on.

248
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,363
What? What channel?

249
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,446
Three-ninety-one.

250
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,866
Three-ninety-one.

251
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,743
Now, promise me you won't tell.

252
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,871
God, I used to love this show.

253
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,415
- Loved it.
- You're just jealous because I...

254
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,709
How did I not know
this was on every night?

255
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:42,715
More importantly, why are the other
girls 15 and Tootie is, like, nine?

256
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:45,325
I don't know.

257
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,096
Has anyone ever told you
you're kind of a Blair?

258
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,056
What? Fuck you.

259
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,966
- Seriously, fuck you.
- Why?

260
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,017
I'm a Jo.

261
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,768
How are you a Jo?

262
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,995
I'm sitting in your outdoor living room,

263
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:00,599
watching TV next to your hot tub.

264
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,943
- Feeling a little Blair-y.
- I'm a fucking Jo!

265
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,904
- Okay!
- Why?

266
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,989
- Who are you?
- I'm a Tootie.

267
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,242
It's layered.

268
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,162
- How are you a Jo?
- 'Cause I'm tough.

269
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,332
I'm from Brooklyn.

270
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,375
- You're from Brooklyn?
- Mm-hmm.

271
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,454
How did I not know that? You don't
sound like you're from Brooklyn.

272
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,339
Oh, I used to have an accent.

273
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,383
- What'd you sound like?
- Like someone from Brooklyn.

274
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,510
Like what?

275
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,971
Like this.

276
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,726
- That is fantastic.
- I hate you.

277
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,841
- You are a Jo.
- Yeah.

278
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,440
- Such a Jo.
- Yeah, man, I'm a piece of work.

279
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:47,529
According to my business partner,
Christopher, my anger is an "issue."

280
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,948
Personally,

281
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,952
I think that your anger
is understandable.

282
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,871
Well, you haven't been
on the receiving end of it.

283
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,752
I mean... there are
healthier ways of channeling it.

284
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,338
- Like meditation.
- I meditate.

285
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,714
In my own way.

286
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,088
♪ You fucking prick, drop dead ♪

287
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,512
♪ You make me sick ♪

288
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,222
♪ Get out of my head! ♪

289
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,895
♪ You're the light ♪

290
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,900
♪ I'm the ghost, you're the night ♪

291
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,778
♪ I'm the shadow, you're the light ♪

292
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,948
Do you do this a lot?

293
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,782
Oh...

294
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,147
No, just every time I
see a person-sized dent

295
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:36,570
in the front bumper of a car.

296
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,373
Okay.

297
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,710
The cops say that hit-and-runs
are almost impossible to solve, so...

298
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,714
But you feel like maybe you might find
the person this way?

299
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,798
Nope.

300
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,509
But it makes you feel better?

301
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,343
Not really.

302
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:56,598
I have an idea.

303
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:00,941
What are you doing?

304
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:02,477
- It's legal. Relax.
- Oh, right.

305
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,068
Oh, no, thanks.

306
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,821
I'm just not... not
really a drugs person.

307
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,157
It's not drugs. It's a plant.

308
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,867
And it will help you sleep.

309
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,244
Mm-hmm.

310
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,674
Um... You totally smoke pot.

311
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,883
All right. I did with Ted, but it's...
I mean, it's been years.

312
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,593
Well, I'm happy to reacquaint you.

313
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,221
Oh, yeah.

314
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,440
You immediately feel nice.

315
00:17:39,796 --> 00:17:40,812
Yeah.

316
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,523
Can I say something weird?

317
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,232
Please.

318
00:17:49,716 --> 00:17:50,716
Thank you.

319
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:52,676
For what?

320
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:55,949
I don't know. Just for
coming into my life, I guess, like...

321
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,453
some weird little pot fairy.

322
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,456
And also just for not...

323
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,459
saying and doing the same stupid shit

324
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,419
that everybody says
and does that just...

325
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,590
makes you feel more alone
than you already are, you know?

326
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,552
And for not being repulsed
by my version of grief.

327
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,057
Thank you.

328
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,310
- For the same.
- Mm-hmm.

329
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,018
I know that it must
be hard for you to be

330
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:27,722
alone in that big house without Steve.

331
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,026
It is.

332
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113
It's really hard.

333
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,114
I miss him.

334
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:38,991
I know.

335
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,536
I know you know.

336
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:46,298
- Light's out.
- You probably shouldn't have anymore.

337
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,895
- I don't think so, 'cause I...
- Yeah.

338
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,170
...can't feel my tongue.

339
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,505
You're so fucking high!

340
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:53,477
Fuck.

341
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,801
Why did you give that to me?

342
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,933
I think I just peed!

343
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,228
Wait, I have to check.

344
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,730
- Oh, my God.
- No, I didn't.

345
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,398
Oh, my God.

346
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,900
Oh, my God.

347
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,827
Good evening.

348
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,328
Good evening.

349
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,915
- Shall I come over?
- Nope, because I'm coming to you.

350
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,583
What?

351
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:30,577
Come on. You've been coming
to me this whole time.

352
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,212
You don't even know where I live.

353
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,047
Oh, yes, I do.

354
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,924
And I'm pulling up right now.

355
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,575
Judy!

356
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:08,999
Can I help you?

357
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,002
You're Steve.

358
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,129
Yeah.

359
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,716
You're alive.

360
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,843
Yeah.

361
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,638
I'm sorry. It's 11:30 at night.

362
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,556
What's... What's happening?
Do I know you?

363
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,975
No. I, uh...

364
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,580
heard a lot...

365
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,521
...about you.

366
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,814
Is Judy here?

367
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,151
Judy doesn't live here anymore.

368
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,390
- She doesn't?
- No. We broke up two months ago.

369
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:42,834
Wow.

370
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,577
This is, uh...

371
00:20:47,105 --> 00:20:48,126
Wow.

372
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,458
Hey, Jen. Um, I can explain.
Please call me back.

373
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,420
I'm so sorry. Please.
Please, please let me explain.

374
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,964
Wait. How do you know Judy?

375
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,917
- I thought she was a friend.
- Okay. Well...

376
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:02,434
If you see her, can you tell her to stop

377
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:03,896
coming around here while I'm at work?

378
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,009
I'm gonna change the locks.

379
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,268
I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm so sorry to bother you.

380
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,687
It's all right. I just gotta go.
I'm running a bath.

381
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,770
Okay.

382
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,815
You know, um...

383
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,264
maybe it's better
if she doesn't know where you live.

384
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,363
Seller's market.

385
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,866
Again, I'm... I'm so sorry.

386
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:34,633
What the fuck? Huh?

387
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,211
- Jen, please.
- What?

388
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,638
- Please. I can explain.
- Okay. Do.

389
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,749
What is going on?

390
00:21:38,783 --> 00:21:40,072
Why don't you tell them what's going on?

391
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:42,232
- No. I...
- Guess Kate & Allie are having trouble.

392
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,845
- It's very complicated.
- No. It's not complicated.

393
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:48,265
Her... fiance is not dead, okay?

394
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,226
I mean, unless that was his ghost
who answered the door last night,

395
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,770
because that...
that would be fucking complicated.

396
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,648
But it's not complicated, Judy,
because he's not fucking dead!

397
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,780
What the fuck? What, do you get off

398
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:00,944
pretending you're going through
the same thing I am?

399
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,404
- No. Of course not.
- No?

400
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,365
Is this a game you're playing with me,
with everybody else?

401
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,868
Making up that whole fucking story?

402
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,830
You don't belong here
because he's not fucking dead, Judy.

403
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,665
He broke up with you!

404
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,758
Probably 'cause you're a fucking lunatic

405
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,467
who lies about him fucking being dead.

406
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,437
- Jen, please settle down.
- Let her talk.

407
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,138
I don't wanna let her talk, Kyle!

408
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:25,802
Oh, now, see, this is getting real.
Judy, you go ahead, honey.

409
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,148
I don't know what to say.

410
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,393
Oh, my God. That was so powerful.
Right, guys? Right?

411
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,479
Jen, I'm so sorry.

412
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:37,561
You have no idea.

413
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,191
I...

414
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,110
I'm sorry to all of you.
I really am. I...

415
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:46,323
I don't know why. I wasn't trying
to pull anything or to hurt anyone.

416
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,909
I never meant to hurt anyone.
I swear to God.

417
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,409
I just...

418
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,416
It's true.

419
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,087
Steve... is alive.

420
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,005
- Yeah, not dead. Alive.
- Yeah.

421
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,343
He didn't die two months ago.
But I did lose him,

422
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,719
because he broke up with me.

423
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,514
- Oh, my God. That is not the same!
- I know.

424
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:12,244
I know.

425
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,023
It's just,
he broke up with me because I...

426
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,862
He broke up with me
because we really wanted to have kids.

427
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,991
And we tried,
and we tried for years, and...

428
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,702
I couldn't.

429
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,165
I just kept having miscarriages.

430
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,377
I'm so sorry.

431
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,770
Thank you.

432
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,717
Let's get you to your room.

433
00:23:59,984 --> 00:24:01,569
That was my fifth one.

434
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,404
I really thought that I was
gonna have a baby and a family.

435
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:13,584
And then to find out that there's just
something that's broken inside of me...

436
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,789
I think just going through all that,

437
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,125
it messed me up a little bit.

438
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,046
I swear, I'm not a bad person.

439
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,674
I'm really not. I...

440
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,302
It doesn't matter.

441
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,096
I should have never come here.

442
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,851
Jen, I'm so sorry that I hurt you.

443
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,728
It's the last thing that I wanted to do.

444
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,980
I really cherish our friendship.

445
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,859
No, I really do.

446
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,947
Shit! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

447
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,824
Jesus Christ.

448
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,827
That is a sad story.

449
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,911
Yeah, if you believe it.

450
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,122
What's wrong with you?

451
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,248
Me?

452
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,125
- What about her?
- Yeah.

453
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,710
Find a different group, Judy.

454
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,003
Fuck, yeah, Linda. Thank you.

455
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,089
Jen, Judy's in pain,
and I know that you are, too,

456
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,170
but that doesn't make it okay for you
to attack someone like that.

457
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:13,349
I mean, don't y'all
hang out all the time?

458
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,096
How did you not know any of that?

459
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,849
I don't know.

460
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,306
Well, either way, Judy has every right
to sit in this circle.

461
00:25:22,384 --> 00:25:26,441
Yeah. I mean, in a way,
her life is sadder than all of ours.

462
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,277
Oh, God. She lied, man.

463
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,364
Jen, everyone's grief
manifests in different ways.

464
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:36,079
Judy lied.
You flew into this terrifying rage.

465
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,453
We are all doing our best,

466
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,831
but you've got to start
reconciling that anger inside of you.

467
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,158
Don't let it cause you more grief
than you already have.

468
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,399
♪ Oh, God ♪

469
00:25:52,432 --> 00:25:53,767
♪ You make me sick ♪

470
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,982
The bad news is,
I may have gone overboard.

471
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:53,069
Like, on some of my stories,
I might have exaggerated a little,

472
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,196
especially about Mrs. Garrett
being drunk.

473
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,782
- Fuckin' Tootie.
- She had her eyeballs diluted.

474
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,745
- Oh, she's right that way.
- Thank you.

475
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:15,752
Hey.

476
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,259
Hi.

477
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,768
- You could have just told me.
- I know.

478
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,479
I just thought... But I didn't, so...

479
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,648
I should have, but I didn't.
I don't know why.

480
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,275
Because you have issues.

481
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:36,821
- You have no idea.
- Yeah, well, I have them, too.

482
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,450
- Well, you're allowed.
- So are you, Judy.

483
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:42,027
I mean...

484
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,953
okay, it's weird...

485
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,580
that you lied about Steve.

486
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,083
I mean, it's... it's fucked up,
you know, but...

487
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,961
maybe it's easier to lie about that
than it is to...

488
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,255
to just tell the truth
about the other stuff.

489
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,799
Maybe.

490
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,429
I'm really sorry that I said
you didn't belong.

491
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,974
And you've... you've lost a lot, too.

492
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,520
But they were just miscarriages.
It wasn't like I have actually...

493
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,731
Well, I think it is an actual... thing.

494
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,901
I mean, not if a Republican is asking.
But...

495
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,153
you heard a heartbeat.

496
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,156
And you fell in love in that heartbeat.

497
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,493
Yeah.

498
00:28:26,854 --> 00:28:29,791
Come on.
I have tissues and whiskey in my room.

499
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,293
- You live here?
- Yeah.

500
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,794
Here?

501
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,514
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

502
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:50,353
So, this is where you were whenever
we would talk on the phone, huh?

503
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,646
Yeah.

504
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,357
They're letting me stay here
till I find a place.

505
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,900
Rooms open up all the time.

506
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,569
Oh, I'll bet.

507
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,198
- God, the smell in here.
- Yeah.

508
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,532
Yeah.

509
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,535
But you get used to it.

510
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,328
Oh, okay.

511
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,745
I didn't think you were ever
gonna talk to me again.

512
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:14,102
- You were so angry.
- I told you you wouldn't like it.

513
00:29:14,144 --> 00:29:15,396
I did not.

514
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,131
- It was a little scary.
- I'm sorry.

515
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,968
Look, um...

516
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,889
my guesthouse is open.

517
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:29,768
Um... It used to be Ted's
music studio, but...

518
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,896
but he's... he's not using it. Um...

519
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,774
But you're welcome to.

520
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,317
Welcome to what?

521
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,705
To come and stay with us.

522
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,739
Wow, that's very generous.

523
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,241
But you don't have to take pity on me

524
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,577
just because I'm a 41-year-old
barren woman

525
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,829
sleeping in an assisted living facility.

526
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,289
Yes, I do.

527
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,375
Seriously, come.

528
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,587
It'd be nice having you there.

529
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,632
Thank you.

530
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,469
- Now can I give you a hug?
- No.

531
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,887
Come here.

532
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,727
That's good.

533
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,606
- You're a good hugger.
- Aww.

534
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,442
All right.

535
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,777
Here we go.

536
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,572
Told you.
