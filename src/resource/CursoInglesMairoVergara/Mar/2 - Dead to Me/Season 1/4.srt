1
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,190
It's time. Time for you to get up.

2
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:27,861
Look in the mirror
and decide who you wanna be today.

3
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,947
Winners aren't born, they're bred.

4
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,616
And in order to succeed hard,
you need...

5
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,076
What is that?

6
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,705
That's my podcast alarm.
The Winners' Strategy.

7
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,069
- ...strategy for...
- Gets me pumped for the day.

8
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,126
Oh! Are you doing self-help?

9
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,334
No.

10
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,503
I don't think so.

11
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:48,465
Look at you.

12
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,592
Yeah. But it's not
like your weird mystical shit.

13
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,677
This is about tools for maximum success.

14
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,889
It'd be great for you, actually.
It's discipline, it's planning,

15
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,058
grabbing the life you want now.

16
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,769
What are you doing?

17
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,729
Shh! I'm grabbing what I want now.

18
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:10,080
I missed you.

19
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:17,118
But I can't be late for work.

20
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,790
Plus, I got to hop on the trampoline
to get my lymph nodes going.

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,249
Can you give me a ride?

22
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,502
I gave you a few last night, didn't I?

23
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,087
I mean to Jen's.

24
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,964
Baby...

25
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,550
when are you gonna start driving again?

26
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,432
Oh, my God!

27
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,269
I'm never driving again.

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,230
It's too triggering.

29
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,066
Baby, how are you supposed
to move past all of this

30
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,194
when you're still living with his wife?

31
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,988
- I don't know how you sleep over there.
- I don't.

32
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,367
I did last night, though.

33
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,496
Oh, I missed this California King.

34
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,872
Missed you in it.

35
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,804
Seriously, though. I'm
worried about you.

36
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,751
Being around them
is not good for your head.

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,671
It's not bad for my head.

38
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,215
Jen and I are becoming
really close friends.

39
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,465
Judy.

40
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,092
What?

41
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,970
What kind of friendship
is based on lies?

42
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,930
And manslaughter?

43
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,015
A layered one?

44
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,601
She doesn't even know
who you really are.

45
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,729
You know what? I'm helping her.

46
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,481
You wanna help her?

47
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,443
Move out, let her move on.

48
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,781
I can't just not be friends with her
anymore. She relies on me.

49
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,826
What, just walk out on her?
I wouldn't even know how to do that.

50
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,495
It's not that hard. Just pick a
fight with her. Push her away.

51
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,165
That's your MO, not mine.

52
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,167
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

53
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,877
You know I'm vehemently anti-conflict.

54
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,838
And if I move out,
where am I supposed to go?

55
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,257
I don't know.

56
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,800
How about...

57
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,011
back to this California King?

58
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,141
I know you still love me.

59
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,769
- Don't do that.
- Come on.

60
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,395
Don't.

61
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,734
You got to admit,
last night felt good, right?

62
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,614
Like how it used to feel.

63
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,282
It did.

64
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,077
And you missed me.

65
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,788
I did.

66
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,294
Maybe we could go back
to the way it was...

67
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,671
before everything happened.

68
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,549
That's such a nice dream.

69
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,885
Or not.

70
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,471
Come home.

71
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,688
Wait. I thought you were
selling the house.

72
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,983
Well, sometimes your strategy changes.

73
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:05,912
Oh, God, you are the California King!

74
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,470
- Oh, hey, Judy.
- Hey.

75
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,265
You must really like that dress.
You wore it yesterday.

76
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Uh...

77
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,351
Yeah, it's my very favorite dress.

78
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,520
- Nice.
- Where's your mom?

79
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,532
She's in her room.
She hasn't come down yet.

80
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,109
Yeah. I don't wanna shock you,
but she's pissed about something.

81
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,698
All right, now, push...

82
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,242
...down the road. Everything you want.

83
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,369
Everything you deserve!

84
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,621
- Hey.
- Hey.

85
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,666
- Hey! Hey.
- Are you okay?

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Are you okay?

87
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,209
Yeah.

88
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,069
I can't believe you went to jail for me.
Why did you do that?

89
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,090
That's what friends are for, right?

90
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,174
No.

91
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,592
It was fine.

92
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,721
- Really?
- Yeah.

93
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,099
I'm so sorry. Steve didn't have
to bail you out. I would've done that.

94
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,060
So, what happened?
Did you have to spend the night there?

95
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,230
Uh, no. I spent the night with Steve.

96
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,150
Okay.

97
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,276
- We fucked.
- Judy...

98
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,360
Like, a bunch of times.

99
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,903
- Judy!
- I know.

100
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,323
I have a weakness for him.
It's like an addiction.

101
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,534
But it was very transformative.

102
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,579
And there is something
that I have to tell you.

103
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,788
Ted was fucking someone.

104
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,682
- What?
- Ted was fucking someone.

105
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:33,776
Our Ted?

106
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:35,335
Yeah. Our Ted.

107

108
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,384
I was up all night
trying to figure out who she is.

109
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,763
How many Bambis do you know?

110
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,681
- Judy, it's a screen name.
- Right.

111
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:52,018
I hope it's not someone I know,
you know, like our chiropractor.

112
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:53,187
That would be a loss.

113
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:55,578
- It's so hard to find a good one.
- Or a mom at school.

114
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,900
Oh, God, I would kill myself
if it's Turid Kristansson.

115
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,694
Wait. Her name's Turid?

116
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,073
She's this Norwegian former supermodel
who takes pictures of herself

117
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,200
bathing with her kids
and posts them on Instagram.

118
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:11,871
Well, I don't think Bambi is Turid
unless Turid is also a waitress.

119
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,360
I'm chatting with her right now
on the game.

120
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:15,458
You are?

121
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,584
Yeah, she thinks I'm Ted.

122
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,836
- Huh?
- Don't. Don't look.

123
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,520
She got a filthy mouth and she can...
Wow! Really paint a picture.

124
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,008
Talking about his cock?
'Cause evidently she misses it.

125
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,635
She is and she does.

126
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,554
Oh, God. A waitress.
Jesus. That's disgusting.

127
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,806
Hey, I was a waitress.

128
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:31,892
- So was I but I need to hate the bitch.
- Okay.

129
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:34,672
I get that you're upset, but don't
be a woman who blames the woman.

130
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,946
Well, who am I supposed to blame?
The man is dead.

131
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,899
Plus, he was married, so she's gross.

132
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,485
She got a new job
at some restaurant in Dana Point.

133
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,987
She thinks that Ted is meeting her
at the end of her shift.

134
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,615
- Oh, we are so going there.
- We so are.

135
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,450
But to do what, exactly?

136
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,335
Well, what I wanna do
is punch her because

137
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,154
she is a slutty little homewrecker.

138
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:57,166
OK. You wanna do that, but if I were
you, I would think of maybe, like,

139
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,919
a less violent strategy.

140
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,089
Fine. Then I wanna know
how the fuck this happened,

141
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,332
when the fuck, why the fuck,
and what the fucking fuck,

142
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,226
- and then tell her that he's dead.
- Okay. That sounds like a plan.

143
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,929
And if I punch her, I fucking punch her.

144
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,353
- Which one do you think is Bambi?
- I'll know her when I see her.

145
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,107
Oh, well, he'd like that ass.

146
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,775
You think it's her?

147
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,403
That's her.

148
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,281
- That's fucking her.
- Her?

149
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,573
Yeah.

150
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,868
- He'd like the blonde.
- Are you sure?

151
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,578
I know my husband.

152
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,121
Sorry. Do you need a table?

153
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,413
Yeah.

154
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,670
Oh, God.

155
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:53,306
Should we get the Macho Nachos
or should we get the Arab Spring Rolls?

156
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:56,091
What is the theme of this restaurant?

157
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,479
Of course she has perfect tits.

158
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,981
- Yours are better.
- Yeah, well...

159
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,191
mine aren't mine.

160
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
What do you mean?

161
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,656
I had the, like,
the double thing, you know?

162
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,909
You had cancer?

163
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,243
No. No, I...

164
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,997
I have the gene,
so I just got ahead of it.

165
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,958
I didn't want my kids
to lose their mom like I did.

166
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,336
Oh, my God. I didn't realize.

167
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,588
How old were you when your mom died?

168
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,214
Nineteen.

169
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,300
So, older than Bambi.

170
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,512
I'm so sorry.

171
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,095
About which part?

172
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,805
All of it.

173
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,602
Have you figured out
what you're gonna say to her?

174
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,646
I just wanna know how many times.

175
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,233
It couldn't be that many times right?
To fly under the radar like that?

176
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,195
I guess. But you gotta know a cock
pretty well to miss it.

177
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,738
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

178
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,533
Welcome to Bliss Pointe. Can I get
you girls started with some apps?

179
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,411
Is your calamari fresh
or is it made from pig assholes?

180
00:08:58,955 --> 00:08:59,955
It's squid.

181
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,750
I just heard some places
use pig assholes.

182
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,378
- How is the Guacadilla?
- Oh, amaze.

183
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:06,973
We'll try that.

184
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:10,383
Yeah. No, you know,
I'll just have another Frojito.

185
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,677
Um, people really love
the Jerk Chicken Kabob.

186
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,179
What is the cuisine
in this place, Bambi?

187
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,767
Is it Asian or Middle Eastern
or, like, Mexican?

188
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,435
Yeah, like, everything, I think.

189
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,605
Um, the owner is, like,
a globalist, I think.

190
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,400
Or he just likes to appropriate
other people's shit.

191
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,049
Yep. She'll have the Kabob.

192
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,069
Okay.

193
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,697
Thanks so much.

194
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,157
Obviously, whatever they had
was just physical,

195
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,827
because could you imagine
having to converse with that?

196
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,747
Okay. Look, if you wanna know
what happened or how many times,

197
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,417
I think open hostility
is probs not the best way to do it.

198
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,081
You realize that that is
the tip of my hostility iceberg?

199
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:48,198
Oh, I do.

200
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:50,179
But I think that you should
really befriend her,

201
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,133
charm her, soften her up.

202
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,678
I'm confronting her, Judy,
I'm not grooming her.

203
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,638
You know what I mean.

204
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,976
Ted was just never a player.

205
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,313
I mean, even when he was touring,
he was, like, the anti-player.

206
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,272
Maybe he wasn't.

207
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,445
Maybe I didn't know him.

208
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,864
- Fuck. Fuck!
- What?

209
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,033
Steve's pulling his
house off the market.

210
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,702
Like I need that shit right now!

211
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,748
We had three fucking offers over asking.
One in all cash.

212
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,917
- God, talk about players.
- Steve's not a player.

213
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,523
He's too scared of disease,
and he's very sensitive to condoms.

214
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,520
He told Christopher
he fell back in love.

215
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,718
Chris always oversells clients
their houses,

216
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,762
like it's fucking Love It or List It
or something.

217
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,014
But, no, it's fucking just,
"List It, Chris."

218
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,726
I think that Steve
might have been talking about me.

219
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,105
Did you know
that he was pulling the house?

220
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,944
I didn't wanna upset you
and we were on another topic.

221
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,780
Yeah.
We're on the topic of assholes, Judy.

222
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,225
At least I didn't know
that Ted was a fucking asshole,

223
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,950
but you have all the information.

224
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,084
I know things weren't good at the end
with me and Steve,

225
00:11:02,117 --> 00:11:04,412
but you were the one who said that
everything that we went through

226
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:06,442
made us crazy. And you're totally right.

227
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,872
I mean, you didn't really know
the kind, nurturing Steve.

228
00:11:10,198 --> 00:11:13,214
Well, what about the Steve
that left you after five miscarriages?

229
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,176
- That's not fair.
- No, it's really shitty. But it's true.

230
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,387
He was hurting. I was hurting.

231
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,806
And then he was hurting
because I was hurting.

232
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,891
He's really been working
on himself, Jen.

233
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,602
So what? I mean...

234
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,398
is he pulling the house
because you're...

235
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,274
you're moving back in there?

236
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,070
I really wanted to tell you this
morning, but I didn't want...

237
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,614
This whole thing with Bambi came up.

238
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,991
You're not even in that house, Judy.

239
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,910
I mean, I have been in every room.

240
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,706
It is all Steve,
as if you've never even lived there.

241
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,959
Well, Steve has a very
specific aesthetic.

242
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,711
What? Modern douche?

243
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,464
He let me put a Buddha
in the guest bath.

244
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,758
You know what?
I can't live your life for you,

245
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,428
but, fuck, would I be making
better choices than that.

246
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:02,112
Well, too bad we can't
live each other's lives.

247
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:04,273
Yeah. It's too bad
because mine's so fucking great.

248
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:06,290
Guacadilla and two Froses.

249
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,852
I wanted a Frojito, Bambi.

250
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,146
Oh, dang. Sorry.

251
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,356
- It's fine.
- I'll drink sewer water at this point.

252
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,191
The Froses are yummo.

253
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
Don't say "yummo."

254
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,068
Okay.

255
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:19,891
You know, I hope this
isn't weird for you, but

256
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:23,993
I just wanted to say that mango
uniform blouse looks awesome on you.

257
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,629
The color just really brings out
the gold in your skin.

258
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,372
OMG, you're so nice!

259
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,832
OMG, you are!

260
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,056
I honestly am really
happy you said that,

261
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,837
because I just got a romper
in this same color for gigging,

262
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,006
and I was like, "Wait,
is this too much?"

263
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,134
- Gigging?
- Yeah, I'm a singer-songwriter.

264
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,178
I play guitar and, like, some piano.

265
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,055
Would we have heard any of your music?

266
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,850
Well, I was working on an album
with my boyfriend,

267
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:50,140
who's, like, crazy talented, but um...

268
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,021
- Your boyfriend?
- Well, he was.

269
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,356
He's been kind of hot and cold lately.

270
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,693
Hot and cold how?

271
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,947
Um... Like, he kind of ghosted me
a couple of months ago,

272
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,159
and then all of a sudden he was like,
"Hey, girl, I'm back.

273
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,579
I'll see you after your shift."
And I was like, "Thanks, Ted."

274
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,292
Ted.

275
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,795
- Ted's your boyfriend?
- He was.

276
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,630
I don't really know what he is now.

277
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,510
How long were you dating, Bambi?

278
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,261
Not that long.

279
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,694
Like a year and a half.

280
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:27,249
- Holy shit.
- I know!

281
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,642
To then not talk to me for three months!

282
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,936
He's lucky I love him.

283
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,317
- A year and a half!
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

284
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,902
- I'm such a fucking fool.
- No.

285
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,239
He was lying to my face
for a year and a half.

286
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,951
How did I not see that?

287
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,913
I don't know.
I think sometimes in relationships,

288
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,874
- people see whatever they wanna see.
- Yeah. You would know.

289
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,169
- It's not the same.
- Please.

290
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,088
You think Steve has
really changed, Judy?

291
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,495
The asshole that just gave you
a restraining order?

292
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,050
Okay. Our relationship is complicated.

293
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,803
- It's not complicated Judy. It's toxic!
- I'm not perfect either.

294
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,680
God! Stop making excuses for him!

295
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,974
Stop projecting! Steve is not Ted.

296
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,560
Before everything happened,
Steve was really good to me.

297
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,479
He was kind. He was loving.
He never cheated on me. He was...

298
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,231
Really?

299
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,778
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck you, Judy.

300
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:24,572
- No, I didn't mean to say that.
- You said it! What did you mean?

301
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,653
I don't wanna fight! Okay?
There's a lot of shit you don't know!

302
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:30,828
Yeah. Well, you know what? Apparently,
I don't fucking know anybody.

303
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,873
Jen! Come on! Where are you going?

304
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:37,209
Uh...

305
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,837
Can I get you another round?

306
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,881
No. I'm just gonna take the check.
Thanks.

307
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,883
But you haven't even
touched your Guacadilla.

308
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,718
- Yeah. It's fine.
- Okay.

309
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,762
Hey, is your friend okay?

310
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,640
She seemed, like, kind of upset.

311
00:14:58,981 --> 00:14:59,982
Ted's dead.

312
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,568
I'm sorry?

313
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,031
Ted, he's dead.

314
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,117
What... what do you mean?

315
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,120
Ted? Like, my Ted?

316
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,871
No.

317
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,248
My Ted.

318
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,251
I'm his wife.

319
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,881
What? No. That's impossible.

320
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,676
Impossible that he's dead
or impossible that I'm his wife?

321
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,052
Both.

322
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,555
He told me you died.

323
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,028
Hey. You okay?

324
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,112
Hey. Yeah.

325
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,864
You look like you saw a ghost.

326
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,990
Thanks.

327
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,660
I'm so sorry about what I said.

328
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,202
It's all right.

329
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,872
What do you need?
Do you wanna go punch her?

330
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,206
No.

331
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,625
I keyed her car.

332
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,087
You did?
How did you know which one it was?

333
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,797
I don't know. I just guessed.

334
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,049
So, you keyed someone's car?

335
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,427
Yup.
And then I bought a pack of cigarettes.

336
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,972
I fucking love you.

337
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,518
Such a fucking joke! So basic.

338
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,187
He just turned this marriage
into a cliche.

339
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,648
Fuck him! Basic bitch!

340
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,816
Totally. You know what?

341
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,485
Maybe we should just pull over and,
you know, talk about it?

342
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,695
No. I'm fine!

343
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,157
Your driving is just a little erratic.

344
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,664
Please, Judy.
Will you please just relax?

345
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:35,953
- Okay. I just need to vent.
- Okay.

346
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,997
Oh, my God!

347
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:40,174
- I'm fine.
- Okay. But you're scaring me!

348
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,750
Fuck! You know what? You drive.

349
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,026
I can light this fucking cigarette.

350
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,077
I don't even want this.

351
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,913
Hey, I'm sorry I scared you. Okay?

352
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,750
You're okay.

353
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,598
We're okay.

354
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,471
The speed limit is 30 in Laguna.

355
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,640
- I know.
- Yeah. But you're going, like, 11.

356
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,266
I'm being safe.

357
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,729
You know that driving slow
is just as dangerous as speeding?

358
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,247
I don't think that's true.

359
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,615
Oh, car agrees with me.

360
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,737
Did I tell you
Laguna is his hometown, right?

361
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,990
It's where he wanted to live,
where he felt safe.

362
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,701
It's like, I just had to figure it out.

363
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,704
How am I gonna make money
and feed four mouths.

364
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,540
But you did it. You
made a beautiful life.

365
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,085
What life? This isn't my life.

366
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,627
This is his life.

367
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,756
I worked to support him and his dreams.

368
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,758
I had my own dreams.

369
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,305
I'm really gonna need you to go faster.

370
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,058
Your dreams, what were they?

371
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,061
- They're stupid now.
- No!

372
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,022
- No. It's embarrassing.
- Come on!

373
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,651
I wanted to be a dancer.

374
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,071
That is not stupid. That's amazing.

375
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,031
I was really good too.

376
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,241
I bet you were.

377
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:43,497
But it just... seemed like his career
was taking off and...

378
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,707
Not to ruin it for you, it didn't.

379
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,594
But, you know,
I'm the one with the uterus,

380
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,296
and I've gotta be the grown-up here,
and for what?

381
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,799
So, he just stopped fucking me

382
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:58,053
and start fucking some 20-year-old
with big, warm tits

383
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,722
who makes him feel like a genius?
Fuck him.

384
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,709
You guys weren't sleeping together

385
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,736
and you didn't think that
maybe something was going on?

386
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,769
No. I did.

387
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,470
And I asked him about it, but he was

388
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:12,412
just so convincing with his
bad back and his depressed

389
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:14,144
"I'm-Never-Gonna-Be-A-Rockstar"
bullshit.

390
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,574
Oh, God. It's Steve.

391
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,036
Of course it is.
He's been texting you all night.

392
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,287
He wants me to go over there.

393
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,123
What do you want, Judy?

394
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,707
Do you wanna go?

395
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,669
Do you wanna move back in with him?

396
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,509
I just want things to
go back to before...

397
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,137
before everything happened.

398
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,681
What, you want it to be the way it was?

399
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,480
Holy shit!

400
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,952
- What are you doing?
- We have to go back.

401
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,154
No! Don't be fucking stupid!
You can't go back!

402
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,618
I don't want things to be
the way they were.

403
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,537
- Good.
- I just wish things were different.

404
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,081
- You and me both, sister.
- I wish I was different.

405
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,043
No. No. Judy, you are great.

406
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,878
You are fucking awesome.

407
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:15,520
Your choices are a little questionable.

408
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,924
Oh. You have no idea.

409
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,551
You don't have to do
what he wants anymore.

410
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,553
Too much has happened.

411
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,680
You know, love is just not enough.

412
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,350
You need space
so that you can be fully you...

413
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,729
or, you know,
you're just gonna end up like me.

414
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,110
And what would you do if you were me?

415
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,039
Oh, hey.

416
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,165
Hello, Steve.

417
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,209
Hello, Jen.

418
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:54,961
What's up?

419
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,755
You should take the cash offer.

420
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,342
It's 200 over asking.
You would be stupid not to.

421
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,428
She's always selling!

422
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:08,016
Look, I get why you'd want me to
do that. I do. And I'm sorry.

423
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,852
But I am pulling the house.
I don't wanna sell.

424
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,440
It's just such a big
house for one person.

425
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,819
Well, it's not just for one person.

426
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,698
Judy is not coming back.

427
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,831
I mean it's not like you ever let her
live in this house to begin with.

428
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,332
You don't have a fucking clue
what you're talking about.

429
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:34,918
You barely know her.

430
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,964
Maybe, but I get her.

431
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,135
Take the offer.

432
00:21:56,284 --> 00:21:58,442
- What happened? What'd he say?
- God! He's a dick.

433
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,902
- I know.
- But he's the worst kind of dick.

434
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,739
He's a secret dick,
because you don't know it at first.

435
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,621
Because he's so
good-looking and charming.

436
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:07,185
Yeah, but he's so
good-looking, that it, like,

437
00:22:07,218 --> 00:22:08,627
comes back around the other side.

438
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,953
Oh, God. Thank you.

439
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,289
- Hmm?
- I could not have done that myself.

440
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,875
Well, I'm so...

441
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:17,210
I don't know why I can't say no to him.

442
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,339
Because you're an addict.
You have to put down the pipe.

443
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,656
By the pipe, you mean his penis?

444
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:23,923
Yes. I mean his penis.
Obviously, I mean his penis.

445
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,327
- It's so hard for me to put that down.
- Is it a big penis?

446
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,597
- It's like...
- Oh, shit. Really?

447
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,057
It's a good version of big.

448
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:33,108
- Good-looking and with a big dick?
- What do you do?

449
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,853
- How do you find that again?
- You don't.

450
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:35,936
I know.

451
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,856
- You...
- I should go back in there?

452
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:41,985
No. You are beautiful,
and you are a good person,

453
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,528
and you have a great heart.

454
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,239
And you would never hurt a fly.

455
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,618
I don't think I deserve that.

456
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,036
Oh, just take it.

457
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,748
Oh, God. What is wrong with me?

458
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,125
Why do I pick guys who
treat me like shit?

459
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,711
I don't know.
I just spent 18 years with a liar.

460
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,130
What does that say about me?
That I wanna be lied to?

461
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,888
I have to tell you something.

462
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,806
What?

463
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,186
He killed you.

464
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,232
What?

465
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,486
Ted. He told Bambi that you were dead.

466
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,697
Breast cancer.

467
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,909
No.

468
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,768
He said that he was a widower and

469
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:37,949
that he was raising the kids all alone.

470
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,419
Uh...

471
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,800
I didn't know if I
should tell you or not.

472
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,846
I don't know if you
should've told me either.

473
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:54,626
I'm sorry.

474
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,895
I can't fucking believe him.

475
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,648
Yeah. I know.

476
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,193
What the fuck have I been doing here?

477
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,199
I've spent months trying to...

478
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,994
bring him justice,

479
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,381
obsessed with trying to find
the person that killed him,

480
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:18,497
and for what?

481
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,043
He fucking killed me.

482
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,421
Yeah.

483
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,883
Yeah.

484
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,889
He's such a fucking asshole.

485
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,933
Right. He's the asshole.

486
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,945
I'm glad he's dead.

487
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,416
Put on your seat belt.

488
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,002
I'm taking us home.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
