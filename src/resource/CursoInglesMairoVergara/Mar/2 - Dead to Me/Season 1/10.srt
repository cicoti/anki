You see what happens?

00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,811
You live with your grandmother
for three days,

4
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,556
and your brother becomes a Christian.

[RABBI RECITES
"MOURNER'S KADDISH" IN HEBREW]

6
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,738
Amen.

7
00:01:55,272 --> 00:01:56,282
Amen.

8
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,446
Where's Judy?

9
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,742
Um...

10
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,328
Judy's not coming.

11
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,706
She's... not gonna be
in our lives anymore.

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,542
Isn't she, like, your best friend?

13
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,418
What? No.

14
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,295
No, not at all.

15
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,047
Barely knew her.

16
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,343
Then why did you let her live with us?

17
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,860
You guys wanna have this chitchat later?

00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:20,089
Henry's about to become
a child of Christ.

19
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,474
Excuse me, rabbi.

20
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,060
I just wanna say
it was such a nice service.

21
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,979
I love that prayer.

22
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,814
It was beautiful.

23
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,549
What did it mean?

24
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,360
That despite losing someone we love,
we still praise God.

25
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,946
Even though God
took away the person we love?

26
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:37,615
If we want God to forgive us,
we have to forgive Him.

27
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,741
I like that.

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,412
It's nice to think of Abe
up in Heaven with God.

29
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,875
That is nice to think of, but...
there is no Heaven.

30
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,961
- Really?
- No Hell either.

31
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,837
Really?

32
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,633
No matter how much bad someone's done
or how many people you've hurt?

33
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,803
Well, in the Jewish faith,
if you've hurt someone,

34
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,346
you've got to try to make amends.

35
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,516
Find a way to compensate
for what you've done wrong.

36
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:05,976
Thank you.

37
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,895
Shalom.

Henry Theodore Harding,

39
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,318
we now wash away your original sin.

40
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,944
What's original sin?

41
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,865
Basically, we're all
born guilty and sinful.

42
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,535
But then when we get baptized,
it's like we get a do-over.

43
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,426
Then, all you have to do is ask for

44
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,865
forgiveness and you get a clean slate.

45
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,584
Isn't that nice?

46
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,755
She's totally fucking lying to you.

47
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,925
Through baptism,
we are all one in Jesus Christ.

48
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,352
I baptize you in the name...

49
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,854
- of the Father and the son...
- Sorry.

50
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,305
...and of the Holy Spirit.

51
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,568
Mrs. Harding. Hi.

52
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,070
Judy Hale killed my husband.

53
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,404
Yeah?

54
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,492
Yeah? What do you mean, "yeah"?

55
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,145
I mean, as of recently, I've been

56
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,293
made aware of her possible involvement.

57
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:09,374
No, no. No, it is not possible.

58
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,583
It is definite.

59
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,418
She confessed it to me.

60
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,502
Okay.

61
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,878
I...

62
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,048
I feel like you're being
cavalier about this.

63
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,350
I'm not trying to be cavalier.

64
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:21,135
- Well, then go arrest her.
- It doesn't work that way.

65
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,771
There are much bigger factors involved.

66
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,347
What factors? God!

67
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,430
The way you talk
fucking annoys the shit out of me.

68
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,434
I'm sorry. But I can't.

69
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,894
It involves another investigation.

70
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,530
And until that plays itself out,
my hands are tied with Ms. Hale.

71
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:36,317
And even then, if she confesses,
it's not enough to warrant an arrest.

72
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:40,754
She is a murderer and she is
walking around free as a fucking bird.

73
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,198
You have to do something.

74
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,547
Okay, I can get you a restraining order.

75
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,192
That'll take me about 24 hours.

76
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:50,081
She killed my husband
and then she moved in with me.

77
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,084
A restraining order isn't gonna do it.

78
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,296
Thank you for fucking nothing again.

79
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,840
Mrs. Harding, wait. Mrs. Harding.

80
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:02,836
For now, try and take comfort
knowing that you have your answer.

81
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,012
Isn't that what you wanted?

82
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,909
You want me to take comfort
in the fact that we live in a world

83
00:05:07,943 --> 00:05:10,819
where everyone knows what the truth is
and there are no consequences?

84
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,229
There will be consequences,
I assure you.

85
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,939
Oh, no. I assure you.

86
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,741
Look at us working together again.

87
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,001
Look at us.

88
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,649
You know, I have to say, having Charlie

89
00:05:29,683 --> 00:05:31,564
at my house has been a real godsend.

90
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,416
It's like having Ted back.

91
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,209
Well, yeah. It's just a phase.

92
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,920
Charlie will come home
when he's done being mad at me.

93
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,803
- Well, I'm glad to be able to help.
- Okay.

94
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,258
Be someone you can turn to.
That's what family's for.

95
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,720
You look tired.

96
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,098
Lorna, I just sold two
of these units for you all cash.

97
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,768
What is it gonna take for you
to just lay off?

98
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,896
Well, you didn't sell anything.

99
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,979
What?

100
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,274
Steve Wood pulled his deposit
this morning.

101
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,734
I thought you knew.

102
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,070
- Why?
- I don't know. He's your client.

103
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,946
Oh, shit.

104
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,741
Well, don't dwell. Circulate the trays.

105
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,551
And do one more Swiffer
of the bathrooms.

106
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,236
I want that faux marble spotless.

107
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,496
Yup. Of course.

108
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,834
Hi. Would you like one?

109
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,419
- No.
- Okay. Great.

110
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,512
- May I offer you a pinwheel?
- No.

111
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,809
Hi. Would either of you like
to try one of these?

112
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,976
- No.
- Okay.

113
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:40,857
Hi.

114
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,777
Good afternoon. Would
you like a pinwheel?

115
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,070
- No.
- Okay. Good.

116
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:11,889
Hi.

117
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,266
Get the fuck out of here!

118
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,026
- Please don't make a scene.
- Then get the fuck out!

I don't want you to get in trouble.
Let me help you.

120
00:07:16,543 --> 00:07:17,570
No, don't fucking help me.

121
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,813
- Shh.
- You shh!

122
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,896
Okay.

123
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,426
- You look really nice.
- Shut up.

124
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,443
- Okay.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

125
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,111
How dare you fucking show up here?

126
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,823
I'm working for Lorna
to keep a roof over my kids' heads,

127
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,366
to keep my life together.

128
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,993
A life that you destroyed.

129
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,076
I know.

130
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,954
That's why I'm turning myself in.

131
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,665
I just wanted you to know I'm gonna
ask for the maximum sentence.

132
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,993
It might be the chair
if that's something that they still do,

133
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,462
but the worst punishment of all
is losing you.

134
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,467
Well, I already turned you in.

135
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:52,310
Yeah. Okay. That's... You should have.
That's right.

136
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:53,982
- Yeah. Yeah. That's ight thing to do.
- Good for you.

137
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,141
- Shut up.
- Okay.

138
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,687
It doesn't even fucking matter,
because your confession isn't enough.

139
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,153
So you get to go walk free and fuck

140
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:04,617
with my head as much as you want to.

141
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,027
I don't wanna fuck with your head.

142
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,572
- Then what do you fucking want, Judy?
- I want to just make amends.

143
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,532
I want you to be okay.

144
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,869
You want me to be okay?

145
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:15,952
Yeah.

146
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,458
You hit my husband and left him to die.

147
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,587
Then you stalk me, you
move into my home,

148
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,006
you get my children to trust you.

149
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,509
You are a fucking sociopath.

150
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,844
- I love you.
- I fucking hate you.

151
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,472
Okay.

152
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:36,766
Stay the fuck away from me.

If there's anything that I can do...

154
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,659
You know what you can do? You can
disappear off the fucking planet.

155
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,609
Okay.

156
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,321
I have Ted's gun in... in my purse.

157
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:57,370
So, if I see you again
or you go anywhere near my family...

158
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,249
I will shoot you in the fucking head.

159
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:03,042
Do you understand me?

160
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,586
Yeah... I do.

161
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,089
Get the fuck out
and don't even come near me.

162
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,966
Get the fuck out of here, Judy.

163

Go. Now!

Yes, Howard. I'm not a fucking idiot.
I know...

00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,715
In a cashier's check.

178
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,635
So you wanna close out the account?

179
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,135
That's right.

180
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,639
Well, we're certainly
sorry to see you go.

181
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,308
Uh, may I ask why you decided
to leave Orange Coast Trust?

182
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,852
I'm going away.

183
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:50,902
Hey, Karen.

184
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,328
Sorry it took me so long
to get this back to you. I just...

185
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,197
Anyway, whatever was
in it was delicious.

186
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,324
It was my take on Mexican lasagna.

187
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,992
Mmm, right. Right.

188
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,994
Well... thank you.

189
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,704
There weren't too many raisins?

190
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,665
Uh-uh.

191
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,458
No way.

192
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,752
- All right. Well, thanks.
- Mm-hm.

193
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,131
Um...

194
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,885
Would you...

195
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:23,140
Do you wanna... come by later,

196
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:27,561
like, after the kids go to sleep
and have a glass of wine by the pool?

197
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,605
You mean socialize?

198
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,983
- Yeah.
- Okay.

199
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,610
- Okay.
- Great.

200
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,112
- So I'll see you there?
- Cool.

201
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,405
- By the pool.
- Yeah.

202
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,073
- Okay.
- Your pool...

203
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,156
What?

204
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,450
Your house?

205
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,661
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

206
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,080
- Do you want me to bring anything?
- No. No.

207
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,332
I could whip something up. I don't work.

208
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,458
No, please don't.

209
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,210
- Just don't do that.
- Okay.

210
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,003
Thanks. See you later.

211
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,255
- See you later.
- Bye.

212
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,928
I'm sorry, that account has been closed.

213
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:01,647
- Sorry, what?
- Yes.

214
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:04,265
The joint person on the account?
Ms. Hale.

215
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,601
She was here earlier.

216
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,397
She was here earlier and she what?
She what?

217
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,399
- She...
- She closed the account.

218
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:21,615
Cool.

219
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,075
Um... Thank you.

220
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,546
Fucking Judy! I'm gonna
fucking kill her!

I'm sorry, this is a closed rehearsal.

Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

239
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,083
I just have a little gift for Henry

240
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:41,061
in honor of his baptism and I thought...

241
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,657
Well, maybe you could
give it to him for me.

242
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
Sure.

243
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,368
I'm his godfather, after all.

244
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,954
He's very lucky to have you.

245
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,622
Yeah.

246
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,795
Hey, what happened with Jen?
Why did you move out?

247
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,381
She didn't tell you?

248
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,925
No, she won't talk about it.

249
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,554
So I assume a violent outburst
is imminent?

250
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,142
Just be kind to her, please.

251
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,395
She really needs a friend right now.

252
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,229
Okay.

253
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,274
I do need you to go.

254
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,775

I just have one last thing
I need to go over with you.

258
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,626
- Okay.
- Okay. You see this over here?

259
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
This white thing?

260
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,379
- Yeah.
- That's a sensor.

261
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:45,342
So if the bird that you think is
your daddy comes to the window,

262
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,879
you can't talk to him
until I turn the alarm off.

263
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,811
It's okay.
Judy got me a bird I can keep inside.

264
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,643
- What?
- You wanna see? It's for my baptism.

265
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,311
Um...

266
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,856
When did you see Judy, Henry?

267
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,693
She came to the Holy Harmonies practice
but Christopher kicked her out.

268
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,446
He doesn't like people seeing us
in an unpolished state.

269
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,071
Okay.

270
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,492
If you ever see Judy again,
you tell me, okay?

271
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,578
You tell me immediately.

272
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,538
I... I hope I see her again.

273
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,957
- I miss her.
- I know.

274
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,752
- I know you loved her.
- You love her too.

275
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,337
We can make other friends.

276
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,004
Right?

277
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,673
Good night.

278
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,885
Good night.

279
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,925
- So glad we're doing this.
- Me too.

280
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,558
Funny, we've been neighbors eight years,
and I've never been over.

281
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,520
Oh! That's... Yeah, that's funny.

282
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,858
It's a lovely backyard.

283
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,776
Oh.

284
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,029
You really went for it
with the security back here.

285
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:33,075
Yeah. Well, thanks.
You can never be too safe, right?

286
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,409
Right.

287
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,623
Did your ADT package come with the
Remote Arm/Disarm Via Mobile App?

288
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,166
Yeah.

289
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,962
- Why do you know...
- I'm kind of a home safety nerd.

290
00:16:46,147 --> 00:16:47,223
Cool.

291
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,841
Cool-cool, cool-cool.

292
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,338
Where do you keep your gun?

293
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,262
Oh, I... I don't...

294
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,317
Yeah, I'm not, like,
not really a gun person.

295
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,101
- I get it.
- Mm-hm.

296
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,853
I didn't think I was either.

297
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,275
But then Jeff got me this adorable
pistol for Christmas and, honestly,

298
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,027
call me a convert.

299
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,028
Okay.

300
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,821
Fun fact.

301
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,583
Did you know if you ask someone
to leave your home and they don't,

302
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,743
you can totally shoot them?

303
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,995
- No, that can't be true.
- It is.

304
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,913
- Fun.
- Mm-hm!

305
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,585
- Okay.
- Okay.

306
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,629
Do you want any more wine?

307
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,548
I should probably get myself home.

308
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,384
If I drink too much,
I break out in full body hives.

309
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:35,569
Actually, wait.

310
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,637
Um...

311
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,354
Would you mind showing
me how to use this?

312
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,898
Uh...

313
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,402
I'm assuming you do that.

314
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:55,199
Armed, stay.

315
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,952
Shit!

316
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,955
What's going on?

317
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,874
It's okay, honey. Just stay in
your room. Just lock the door.

318
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,251
- Lock the door.
- What?

319
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,813
Charlie!

320
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,316
Mom, open the damn door!

321
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,914
Charlie, you scared the shit out of me!

322
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:18,155
You scared me.
Those lights are fucking aggressive.

323
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,992
Okay. Hold on. Let me
turn this thing off.

324
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,538
Disarmed, ready to arm.

325
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,374
Hey, you're home.

326
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:32,136
Yeah. Grandma kept calling me Teddy
and touching my face.

327
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,922
Well, that's disturbing.

328
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,256
Yeah.

329
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,469
She has a pill problem.

330
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:40,928
Mmm.

331
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,266
Hand them over.

332
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,521
- I... I wasn't gonna sell them.
- Mm-hm.

333
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,399
I was saving her from herself.

334
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,066
Really?

335
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,486
Really.

336
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,945
Okay.

337
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,407
I'm glad you're home.

338
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,411
Honey, I'm...

339
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,749
I'm so sorry
that I've been such a shit mom.

340
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,251
- It's all right.
- No.

341
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,420
No, it's not all right.

342
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:19,509
I'm sorry that I...
that I get so angry sometimes.

343
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,891
And that you saw your dad and me fight,
especially that night.

344
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,391
Okay.

345
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,687
No, really.
I need you to forgive me, Charlie.

346
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,941
I want a clean slate with you.

347
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,069
Just don't be an asshole anymore.

348
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,864
Well, that's, you know,
kind of a big ask.

349
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:43,533
Come here, baby.

350
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,870
Mmm! Oh, God, I love you.

351
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,080
I love you too.

352
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,247
What?

353
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,251
What are those words I just heard?

354
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,211
You didn't say, "Fuck you too"?

355
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,380
- Yeah.
- You said, "I love you too"?

356
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,839
No.

357
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,467
Best day ever.

358
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,011
- Best day ever.
- Okay.

359
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,638
No. I just need a little more.

360
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,265
Come on, now.

361
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,571
Better put this fucking gun away.

362
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,363
Oh, my God.

363
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,495
Judy?

364
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,040
Judy?

365
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,710
Where's Judy?
I need to speak to her immediately.

366
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,961
Well, she's not here.

367
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,463
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

368
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,642
You know, you could've told me that
you're pulling that offer.

369
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,155
It really did fuck me, you know that?

370
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,678
Yeah, well, Judy fucked me.

371
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,766
- There you go. She ruined my life.
- Well, you're not alone.

372
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,230
I told you. Anywhere Judy goes,
chaos follows.

373
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,023
Yup.

374
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,151
You did.

375
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,905
I was just trying to look out for you.

376
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,077
Do you want a drink or something?
I can get you a glass.

377
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,455
I don't need a glass.

378
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:05,759
She destroyed me, Jen.

379
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,054
My whole life, my family,
everything I worked for,

380
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,931
it's all gonna disappear.

381
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,473
What happened?

382
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,935
I can't really get into it.

383
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,897
What? She run someone else over?

384
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,360
She told you?

385
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,489
Yeah.

386
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,743
Shit.

387
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,924
Would it make any difference if I...

388
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,428
if I told you I'm sorry?

389
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,807
Not that I was the one driving.

390
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,354
You were in the car?

391
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Jen, that was...

392
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,033
honestly one of the worst moments
of my entire life.

393
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,077
I'm so sorry.

394
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,161
Thank you.

395
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,413
It...

396
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,584
It just killed me not to tell you,

397
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,586
especially once...

398
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,590
I don't know, once I got to know you.

399
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,889
You know, in so many ways,
I feel like we are...

400
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,683
we are in this together.

401
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,977
- You know?
- Are we?

402
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,060
Yeah.

403
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,482
That's why I need you to help me.

404
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,900
I gotta find Judy.

405
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,902
Can you help me do that?

406
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,237
Why didn't you stop?

407
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,113
What?

408
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,324
That night.

409
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:55,993
Oh.

410
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,039
I mean, I wanted to.

411
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,208
Judy said she wanted to go back,
but she couldn't.

412
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,377
Why not?

413
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,216
I don't... I don't know.

414
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,635
I don't know. She just didn't.

415
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,469
And you didn't.

416
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,515
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

417
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,477
Don't turn this into some
"blame the man" thing.

418
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,811
That's bullshit. Don't.

419
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,397
We both know what Judy is capable of.

420
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,149
Yeah. And I know what you're capable of.

421
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,777
Oh, you have no fucking idea.

422
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:33,540
Hey, her hand was on the wheel.
Her foot was on the gas.

423
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,093
So don't fucking look at me like that.

424
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:36,183
Fuck you.

425
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:38,870
Fuck you! She was driving. She did it.

426
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,122
- What did you say? Huh?
- Okay.

427
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,208
After she hit him, what did you say?

428
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,251
I don't remember.

429
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,968
Holy shit!
We have to get the fuck out of here.

430
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,678
Drive the car, stupid!

431
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,477
I'm so sorry.

432
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,778
I'm so sorry.

433
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,324
One of the worst moments in your life,
and you don't remember?

434
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,784
I don't remember.

435
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,296
I'm so sorry.

436
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,260
Judy would have stopped.

437
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,013
Did you not hear me the first time
I said it? I don't remember.

438
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,848
Okay. You need to leave my house
right now.

439
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,391
Jesus fuck.

440
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,352
- I'm a good guy, Jen.
- No, you're not a good guy.

441
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,114
You're defending her,
and you're pulling a fucking gun on me?

442
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,033
I want you to leave my house.

443
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,127
Give me the gun Jen. Come on honey.
You don't know what you're doing.

444
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,329
- Don't come any closer!
- I'm not going anywhere

445
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,873
until you tell me where
the fuck Judy is.

446
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,254
What the hell are you doing?

447
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,106
Get out of the road!

448
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,572
Jesus!

449
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,703
Hello?

450
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,249
Judy... I need you to come home.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
