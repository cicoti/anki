1
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,603
- Such a weird thing that people do.
- What? The whole shrine thing?

2
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,397
They put all this shit here.

3
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,400
It's not like this spot
meant anything to Ted.

4
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,570
Well, it was the last place
he got to be alive.

5
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,239
Yeah, I mean, it is the first place
he got to be dead too.

6
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,411
Why is there always a cross?
People always put a cross.

7
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,913
That is so presumptuous to me.
He was not religious.

8
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:39,997
Well, hey, hey...

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,880
- What?
- Maybe you should just leave it there.

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,042
Just in case.

11
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,419
In case what?

12
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:45,836
Uh!

13
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:48,738
In case non-existent God smites me?

14
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,011
I'm standing next to my dead husband's
shrine on the side of a road.

15
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,764
Trust me, I've been smited.

16
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:00,887
<font color="6d6d6d">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#f7f4f4">reggielist</font>
<font color="6d6d6d">www.addic7ed.com</font>

17
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:02,936
And that's gone.

18
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,650
Sorry.

19
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,489
Here comes your boyfriend.

20
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,074
He's not my boyfriend,
we're just hanging out.

21
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:17,002
He has very healthy boundaries,
which evidently is a real thing

22
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,537
- people can have.
- Nope. Can't. Doesn't happen.

23
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,206
- Does this look like a napkin?
- Nope.

24
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:23,212
- Hi.
- Hey.

25
00:01:23,246 --> 00:01:25,794
- Hi. Thank you for doing this.
- Of course. Hi.

26
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,764
- It's really cool of you to come.
- Happy to be of service.

27
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,300
So, this is where Ted's body was found.

28
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,294
I guess that's one good use
of the shrine. I can always

29
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,430
find where my husband was mowed down.

30
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:39,349
Who found him?

31
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:42,102
Shandy Addams. She was
walking to school.

32
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,980
- A child found him?
- Yeah. She's a classmate of Henry's.

33
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,483
- So she's ten?
- She's nine.

34
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,387
No traffic cams.

35
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:53,205
No homes in the eye-line.
You said it was about 1:00 a.m.?

36
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,448
Yeah. Yeah, it was 1 a.m.

37
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,053
No eyewitnesses, I'm guessing?

38
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,766
No. But, I mean, there's got to be some

39
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,486
evidence that the police missed, right?

40
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:04,165
I mean, like a cigarette butt,
or a piece of the car?

41
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,459
Hmm. I'm sure they did
a thorough search.

42
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,171
Any usable evidence is long gone.

43
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,434
Yeah, well, I don't really know

44
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,563
exactly what the police did
because they won't talk to me.

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,980
They have to.

46
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,148
Well, I've...

47
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,818
- kind of been a raging bitch.
- Demanding.

48
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,653
Well, that's fair to say.

49
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:35,527
- They hate me.
- That's also true.

50
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,322
Okay.

51
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,909
Well, that'll be my first stop then,
Laguna PD.

52
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,120
They're more likely to talk
to another cop.

53
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,497
I mean, I'm sure
they already talked to Shandy,

54
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,166
the girl that found him, right?

55
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,960
You know, she was okay.
She went to school the next day.

56
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:50,715
How are your kids doing, by the way?

57
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:54,556
You know, people always ask me that,
and I really appreciate it.

58
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,758
But they're... they're...

59
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,844
surprisingly good.

60
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,972
Yeah. Kids are just resilient.

61
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,099
Your son's been dealing drugs.

62
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,186
Oh, my God.

63
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:12,859
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.
Charles, what the hell are you thinking?

64
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,159
- I was running a small business.
- Excuse me?

65
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:18,573
Does your small business
have liability insurance?

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,327
Because Tucker Tanner drove his Honda
through his mother's greenhouse,

67
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,668
when he was on the drugs you sold him.

68
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:26,623
Is... Is Tucker okay?

69
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,915
Luckily, Tucker's parents were
very understanding,

70
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,477
considering your recent loss.

71
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,508
Of course, you're still
responsible financially.

72
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,670
Oh, my...

73
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,884
What a nice fucking greenhouse.

74
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,261
So, um...

75
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,184
you had that property out
in Laguna Niguel, didn't you?

76
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,354
The one... How's that going down there?

77
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,707
How's Glenn?

78
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,274
I wouldn't know. He moved to Temecula.

79
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,611
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry.

80
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:58,577
- I didn't...
- No, I'm much happier now.

81
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:01,106
Hm... you seem... changed.

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,577
- Can I go now?
- You're not going anywhere ever again.

83
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,121
You're dealing drugs?

84
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,041
What are you? In the fucking Mafia?
Excuse me.

85
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,279
What kind of drugs are you dealing?

86
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:17,632
Uppers, downers, hydrocodone, lorazepam.

87
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,715
Lorazepam?

88
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,802
Yeah. It's good.

89
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,053
Okay.

90
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,597
All right. Well, um...

91
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,060
obviously, he needs to be punished,

92
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,606
but that was Ted's department,
so I don't... What do we do?

93
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,818
Well, normally,
I would report this to law enforcement.

94
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,112
But given what he's
been through, I won't.

95
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,822
This time.

96
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,622
Thank you.

97
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:46,077
But I am gonna have to suspend him
for two weeks.

98
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,788
Maybe in that time,
he can get some counseling.

99
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,024
And I know that Pastor Wayne has a group

100
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,867
for troubled teens down at the church.

101
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,336
Well, I mean, he needs to be punished,
not tortured.

102
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,924
It would be helpful to understand
where he got the pills.

103
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,803
Tell her where you got
the pills from, Charlie.

104
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:04,886
No.

105
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,224
I... I can't.

106
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,891
Thank you for taking me on a ride along.

107
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,977
It's so fascinating
to see how cops solve stuff.

108
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:54,812
No problem.

109
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,003
You know, it's nice to have company.

110
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,193
What do you think it does to a
nine-year-old to find a bloody corpse

111
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,444
by the side of the road?

112
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,947
Um... I'm gonna go with
"scars her for life."

113
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,077
But maybe it becomes a defining moment

114
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,789
that turns her into
an incredibly compassionate adult?

115
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,374
No, I don't think so.

116
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,417
Detective Perez, how can I help you?

117
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,324
Keep in mind
I have less than five minutes.

118
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:22,632
Hey, former Detective Prager.
This is my friend, Ms. Judy Hale.

119
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:23,966
I know Ms. Hale.

120
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:25,259
You do?

121
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:26,893
It's a long story.
She doesn't have time.

122
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,388
- Nice to see you.
- Hmm.

123
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:29,869
Your hair looks good.

124
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:32,517
So, I'm here on behalf of Jen Harding.

125
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,520
I guess you're aware that
she's getting pretty impatient.

126
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,356
I'm sorry. Did you say
"former detective"?

127
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,734
On leave. Santa Ana PD.

128
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,446
Hey, maybe you know Pete Austin,

129
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,865
transferred down here in 2012,

130
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,951
mustache, kind of...

131
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,036
kind of cold sense of humor?

132
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,413
No.

133
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,293
Okay. Well, I offered to help
Mrs. Harding out and,

134
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,797
you know, maybe liaise with you,
help relay any information.

135
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,716
You know this case
has been open for months.

136
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,385
More help is not what we need.

137
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,096
- You need a lead.
- I do. And I don't have one.

138
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,305
Wow, not one?

139
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,810
I know Mrs. Harding
would like more information.

140
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,147
But without an eyewitness, CCTV,
or a vehicle, I've got nothing.

141
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,021
Except an angry widow running
around town like a white wine vigilante.

142
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,945
So, former Detective,
honestly, if you want to liaise,

143
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,573
you can tell Mrs. Harding
what the statistics are

144
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,336
of solving a hit-and-run
with no evidence.

145
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,535
What are those statistics exactly?

146
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,260
The Internet's all over the map on that.

147
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,290
About eight percent of them get solved.

148
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,584
Eight percent?

149
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,126
Mmm.

150
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,879
That's very low.

151
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,382
All right.

152
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,928
Here you go. Let me know if you need me
to shit in a bowl or something.

153
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,514
You know what? You can lose the
attitude, okay, drug dealer?

154
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,489
- What would your father say?
- Probably nothing, because he's dead.

155
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:59,861
Well you know what?
That doesn't give you permission

156
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,190
to throw out every single rule
and act like an asshole.

157
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,733
Okay. You're one to talk.

158
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,360
Okay. You know what? Hey!
I'm not fucking around right now.

159
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,238
No laptop, no phone, no TV.

160
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,993
That is just the start. Because I can't

161
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:13,150
think of anything more
creative right now.

162
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,536
- Whatever.
- No, not whatever. Stop. Hey!

163
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,456
The dominoes have fallen, bro.

164
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,789
You pushed them.

165
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,502
And you pushed me,
which was a really bad idea.

166
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,422
I'm not scared of you.

167
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,133
Well, you should be scared of me.

168
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,898
Ooh! Is that beer?
I would love one if there's more.

169
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,727
Actually, this is Charlie's pee.

170
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,425
I don't have anymore, but I'm
sure he could make you some.

171
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,065
Is he on drugs?

172
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,903
I don't know,
but he is definitely selling pills.

173
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,613
- No.
- Uh-huh. Yup.

174
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,366
Ted was the good parent
and I'm the fucking terrible one.

175
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,410
- That's not true. You're a good mom.
- Yeah. And you're a good liar.

176
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,119
It's bad.

177
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,218
I've just...
I've been asleep at the wheel.

178
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,213
How are you supposed to know
what's he's doing?

179
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,533
They're not your pills, right?

180
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,876
No. Oh...

181
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,423
- Look at you!
- Too formal?

182
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,926
Uh... For a class recital, maybe.

183
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,136
That's okay. I've got a strong second.

184
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,263
Okay.

185
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,056
Oh.

186
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,559
What's the verdict?

187
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,602
It's all clean.

188
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,104
Oh, I mean, fuck!

189
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,814
Fucking... He could've killed a kid.

190
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,983
Imagine if he murdered someone.

191
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,160
- I think it would be manslaughter.
- Yeah, but...

192
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,820
It would definitely ruin his life.

193
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,573
And him carrying
around the burden of that?

194
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:34,949
Ooh, that'd be heavy.

195
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,826
I mean, not to mention
the victim's family.

196
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,189
And he doesn't even give a shit.

197
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,616
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna make him give a shit.

198
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:41,672
How?

199
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,667
Well, a good mother
would take him to therapy,

200
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,378
let him talk it out.
But that just takes too long. So...

201
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,548
- I'm gonna scare the shit out of him.
- Mom?

202
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,842
- Hmm?
- Is this handsome?

203
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,595
- So handsome.
- The handsomest.

204
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,931
At least there's him.

205
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,641

They just messed up the whole show.

231
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,481
I'm quitting this stupid choir!

232
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,483
Oh, fuck me.

233
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,821
Unfortunately,
this isn't an isolated incident.

234
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,618
Henry is often quick to anger
when things aren't just so.

235
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,245
Yeah. I just don't know
why nobody told me this was happening?

236
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,065
Oh, I would've.
But Ted was my home contact.

237
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,877
You never updated it.

238
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,297
He was such an involved father...

239
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,468
Yeah. Well, you know,
I'm... doing the best I can.

240
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,012
We all miss him so much.

241
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,475
Thank you, thank you.

242
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,269
Oh, gosh.

243
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,185
What happened to your arm?

244
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,981
I got hit by a bus.

245
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,817
Oh, my God. And that's your only injury?

246
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
Yeah.

247
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:20,531
Well, I ruptured my spleen,
and splintered my coccyx, and...

248
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,701
- perforated my eardrum.
- Oh.

249
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,248
Hi, Shandy.

250
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,874
Hi!

251
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,252
You were so great up there.

252
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,255
- You just oozed personality.
- I know.

253
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,894
I wanted to say that I'm sorry
about everything that you went through

254
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,261
with finding Henry's dad.

255
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,973
I bet that was really scary for you.

256
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,517
Are you okay?

257
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,229
Were you by yourself that morning?

258
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,650
Or did you see anything, um... weird?

259
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,695
Yeah, a dead body. It was gross.

260
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,489
Was it?

261
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,492
Yeah, because his leg
was twisted across his body,

262
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,455
and his face was half-on, half-off,
like someone bit it then chewed it,

263
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,000
then spit it back into the head.
Then hit it with a car.

264
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,420
- Oh, that sounds very traumatizing.
- It was awesome.

265
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,346
I went home and drew a picture of it.

266
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,862
But then my mom made me throw it away.

267
00:13:19,895 --> 00:13:21,544
Yeah, because you're morbid.

268
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,931
I'm so sorry.
I told her to stop telling that story.

269
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,226
She is very good with details.

270
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,311
- It's impressive.
- It's upsetting.

271
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,481
Which psychopath is yours?

272
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,194
Oh, Henry. I'm a friend of his mom's.

273
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,569
So, kind of.

274
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,573
- I'm Judy.
- Ally.

275
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,954
I've been meaning to come check in
on Jen. Have they caught the guy?

276
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,413
No.

277
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,916
Uh-uh. Um...

278
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,336
There isn't any evidence to go on, so...

279
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,671
Sorry to hear that.

280
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,715
Yeah. It is a shame.

281
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,676
Okay. So...

282
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,471
let's leave this nice lady alone.

283
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:09,849
Excuse us.

284
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,434
Did you really need to talk to her
that whole time?

285
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,334
I don't understand why you stopped

286
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:16,074
the show and screamed at all those kids.

287
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:19,984
Mom, all they have to do
is sing the pedal tone.

288
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,945
Everyone wants to show off
and sing the melody.

289
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,780
But not everyone's a natural soprano.

290
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:30,703
- Mmm. I'm sorry. What's a pedal tone?
- It's literally one note over and over.

291
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,955
They have to learn one note and sing it.

292
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,165
One stupid note.

293
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,959
It's, like, come on!

294
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,052
- Were you singing your part correctly?
- Mommy, please.

295
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,507
- I'm sorry.
- I just want it to sound good.

296
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,968
I don't wanna be blamed
for their mistakes.

297
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,219
But, sweetheart,

298
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,806
the only person that anyone thought
made a mistake today was you.

299
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,518
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

300
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,020
I get it.

301
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,273
I haven't been the best example.

302
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,400
But you know what?

303
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,277
Mommy's got her hands on the wheel.

304
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:04,695
Okay?

305
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,707
Just stay in your room. Okay?

306
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,123
Police! Open up!

307
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,375
Charlie Harding!

308
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,089
- Hey.
- All right. Here we go.

309
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,423
Where's Charlie?

310
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,012
What's going on? Mom?

311
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:32,131
Yeah? Hi. What's happening here?

312
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:34,782
Please stay where you are, ma'am.
You, up against the wall. Now!

313
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,393
Hands on the wall, spread your legs.

314
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,000
This is gonna scare the shit out of him.

315
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:39,346
Oh, my God. It scared me.

316
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,023
Officer, I don't understand.

317
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,106
The school said
they wouldn't call the authorities.

318
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,568
Well, somebody did.

319
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:49,615
Charlie here has gotten himself
mixed up in some pretty dangerous shit.

320
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,368
Okay. I was just selling to my friends.
I swear.

321
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,870
Before I search you,

322
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,506
are there any sharp objects
in your pockets I should be aware of?

323
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,539
- No.
- No?

324
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,959
Yeah. My lucky pen.

325
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,585
Oh! The lucky pen.

326
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,629
Mom, can't you do something?

327
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,797
No, I cannot.

328
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,172
Is this your bag?

329
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,801
- Don't...
- Don't "don't" me, son.

330
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,554
- Oh, my God. You are doing so good.
- Super sexy.

331
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,225
Something in your bag
you don't want me to find, huh?

332
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,603
Some eh... drugs, maybe?

333
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,648
You know, some pills?

334
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:28,099
The fuck is this?

335
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:29,885
- Jesus Christ!
- Holy shit!

336
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,892
What the hell are you doing with a gun?

337
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,725
Where did you get this gun, Charlie?

338
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,954
I stole it from Grandma.

339
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,789
- The safety is off.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

340
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,573
Okay. I'm done playing here. Okay.

341
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:43,678
- This is way more serious.
- Yeah. Yeah, no, no. No, it's fine.

342
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,886
How long has this been
bouncing around your backpack loaded?

343
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,715
You could have killed somebody.

344
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,883
Statistically, yourself.

345
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,609
I... I wasn't gonna use it. I swear.

346
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,665
I just took it in case
something happens.

347
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:55,329
In case what happened, honey?

348
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:57,704
I don't know. Something bad.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

349
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,423
Honey. Honey!

350
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,103
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

351
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,939
Let's just call it off, right, guys?

352
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:05,193
You can do that? I mean...

353
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:07,860
Yeah, I can, because I'm
a very powerful woman, so...

354
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,823
Somebody could've gotten shot.

355
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,783
God, I know.

356
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,078
Nothing more dangerous
than a stupid kid with a gun.

357
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,038
Are you okay?

358
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,250
It's how it happened.

359
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,170
With my partner, Lucas.

360
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:31,175
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. Thanks.

361
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,348
Is there anything I can do
to help you... feel better?

362
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,228
- Mmm... I can maybe think of something.
- Mmm!

363
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,940
First, I should probably
get rid of this gun, though, you know?

364
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,027
- Yeah. Please.
- Immediately and safely.

365
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,946
So, uh, lunch tomorrow?

366
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,448
Yes. I would love that.

367
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,201
Can you wear that outfit?

368
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,037
- Because I would also love that.
- Okay. Let me think about it.

369
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,288
- Okay.
- All right.

370
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,048
"In case something bad happens."
I mean, what does that even mean?

371
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,841
I don't know.

372
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,261
Oh, my baby. Why doesn't he feel safe?

373
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,097
It's scary being a kid.

374
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,703
Especially if your dad's taken away

375
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:21,220
from you in the middle of the night.

376
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,476
Right.

377
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,023
I never knew my dad
and I was a basket case.

378
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,318
Well, I knew my dad
and I was a fucking peach.

379
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:32,520
Oh, seriously?

380
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:34,855
No, I was a total cunt. My mom hated me.

381
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:41,078
Oh, God! Why did he have to have a gun?
I fucking hate guns.

382
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,281
- Don't you have one in that safe?
- No, that's Ted's.

383
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,333
- Lorna gave it to him for Christmas.
- No.

384
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,418
- In his stocking.
- No!

385
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,502
Yeah.

386
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,339
- Oh, my God. She loves guns.
- I know.

387
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,758
What am I gonna do?

388
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,055
I mean, I should be able to
make him feel protected and...

389
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:05,644
secure and watched over. I mean,
that's what a good parent does, right?

390
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,106
I think that's what God does for people.

391
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,734
Gives them a sense of security
that there's a higher power.

392
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,319
Even if it is all bullshit.

393
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,113
Is that why you kept that thing?

394
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,615
I didn't feel right throwing it out.

395
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,034
Now you're covering all the bases.

396
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,203
I can use all the help I can get.

397
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,543
They were Ted's pills.

398
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,629
That Charlie was selling.
They were Ted's.

399
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,465
- All of them?
- Yeah.

400
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,513
Do you think maybe he had, like,
a problem?

401
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,016
I honestly don't know. I...

402
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,894
If he did, I didn't see it.

403
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,606
It's just crazy. You can live
in the same house with someone

404
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,941
and have no idea
what they're going through.

405
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,536
So Ted took a lot of pills.

406
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,621
He was cheating.

407
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,000
And he goes out running at 1:00 a.m.?
Who does that?

408
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,811
I mean, maybe he was depressed and he

409
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:13,245
threw himself in front of that car.

410
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,587
It's possible.

411
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:15,663
Hmm?

412
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:17,799
It was a shitty thing to do
to that family.

413
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,219
Maybe he was filled with pain.

414
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,720
Or guilt.

415
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,833
Hmm.

416
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:25,057
- Shitty thing to do to that driver.
- Right?

417
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,017
It's far more likely if he was on pills

418
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,180
that he stumbled on the road
when the car was coming.

419
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,188
- Hmm.
- But, you know, um...

420
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:37,611
every time we're together,
we don't have to talk about Ted.

421
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,488
Of course.

422
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,282
I like being with you, Judy.

423
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,409
Uh, it makes me feel good.

424
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,912
It makes me feel good too.

425
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,833
Sorry, but if Ted stumbled, it
wouldn't be the driver's fault, right?

426
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,626
Right.

427
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,665
Are there also cases where

428
00:20:55,828 --> 00:20:58,306
the victim is intoxicated and
stumbles out on the road,

429
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,300
and the driver who hits them gets off?

430
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,303
Sure. If they stop driving.

431
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,723
See, the hit isn't the crime.
The run, that's the crime.

432
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,559
- Right.
- But that doesn't really matter here.

433
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,803
Why not?

434
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:13,355
'Cause there's no evidence
pointing us to a car.

435
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,067
There's no car pointing us to a person.
So, no car, no crime.

436
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,737
- No car, no crime?
- Mm-hm.

437
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,782
No car, no crime.

438
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,035
So what do you do
when faced with a choice

439
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,497
that could change the destiny
of your entire life?

440
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:35,210
You make one bad decision
and you spend the rest of your life

441
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,422
digging yourself out of a hole
you didn't even know you were digging.

442
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,925
For the next ten Saturdays,

443
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,803
we are going to discuss
what constitutes a good decision.

444
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:01,869
Work it, work it, work it.
Juice it, juice it.

445
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,325

452
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:27,387
Oh, come on. Mommy, they're fierce.

453
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:29,181
They're fierce.

454
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,667
Speaking of miracles, my two angels.

455
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:33,977
Uh, don't get excited.
We're on our way out.

456
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,771
Oh, they're amazing.

457
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,899
Oh, well, maybe somebody wants
to be a Holy Harmonizer.

458
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,982
Really?

459
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,213
I mean, I'm not quite on their level.
But I work hard and I care.

460
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:46,948
Henry, the group is always
looking for boys.

461
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,159
No. No, no.

462
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,995
- Why? Mom.
- Okay. Not to overstep,

463
00:22:52,358 --> 00:22:57,334
but this would be good for him
and it'd be mean if you didn't let him.

464
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,336
Hmm?

465
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:02,506
- Can we just try?
- Please? I'll do anything.

466
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,424
Please. Can I at least just try?

467
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,511
Oh... fine.

468
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,931
- Godspeed, kid.

Ally, hi.

472
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,444
Sorry for dropping by unannounced.

473
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:27,954
I just had a little chat
with Shandy about

474
00:23:27,988 --> 00:23:29,772
the morning she found Ted's corpse.

475
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,284
Just say body.

476
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,829
- Right.
- Yeah.

477
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:34,995
Sorry.

478
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,542
Shandy has something
she needs to show you.

479
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,963
Hand it over.

480
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:50,387
She took a little souvenir
from the site of Ted's accident.

481
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,765
And now I have to deal with the fact
that my child's a sociopath.

482
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,224
What is that?

483
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,769
I think it's maybe from a headlight.

484
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,353
Maybe.

485
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,818
Maybe it'll help lead the police
to the car that did it?

486
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,235
Oh, my God.

487
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,113
I'm so sorry.

488
00:24:08,568 --> 00:24:11,199
- It was stuck to Mr. Harding's cadaver.
- Body!

489
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,371
Thank you.

490
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,841
- If you ever wanna grab a coffee or...
- No.

491
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,179
No car, no crime. No car, no crime.

492
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,707
My God...
