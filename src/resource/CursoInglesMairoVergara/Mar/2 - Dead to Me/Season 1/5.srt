1
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,278
Uh. This was a good idea. You were
right. I just needed a vacation.

2
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,446
- Right?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,777
- A little holiday?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:33,644
Palm Springs, you know,
get away from it all?

5
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:34,678
Mm-hm.

6
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,411
"Codependent No More".

7
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,955
Doing a little light
reading by the pool?

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,081
Yes, I am.

9
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,926
I'm trying to unpack everything
with Steve, now that it's over. Again.

10
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:46,367
I need to learn how to be on my own,
take care of myself.

11
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,465
Oh, your shoulders are getting pink!

12
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,258
- Let me get that.
- You are codependent.

13
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,467
Right?

14
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,138
- Is it weird that I like it?
- I love that you like it.

15
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,848
You know what I also like?

16
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:59,666
I like a margarita
by the pool in a plastic cup.

17
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:00,761
- Oh!
- Yeah.

18
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:03,166
In fact... Can I get one more?

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,774
Okay, well,
codependent reminder to hydrate.

20
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,651
Because it's 11:30 in the morning,
and you have to pace yourself.

21
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,154
Yeah. Well, you know what,
this is me pacing myself.

22
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,239
And I wanna be very clear.

23
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,242
Mommy can do whatever she wants.

24
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,953
Oh. Is Mommy calling herself Mommy?

25
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,622
- Mommy is.
- Oh.

26
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,584
Mommy's kids are with the grandmother,
and Mommy ain't got shit to do.

27
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,504
Mommy does have some shit to do.

28
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,547
- No shit.
- Jen? Judy?

29
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,465
Hi, Pastor Wayne.

30
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,227
I'm so happy you could make it
to our Friends of Heaven Grief Retreat.

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,261
Grief treat!

32
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,681
I do hope you'll take
the opportunity this weekend

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,559
to imbibe some of our
therapeutic workshops.

34
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,646
This weekend could be
a real turning point for you.

35
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,398
I'm so excited.

36
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,777
I'm really looking forward
to taking a look inward.

37
00:01:50,854 --> 00:01:51,859
Kiss-ass!

38
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:54,013
There are seminars specialized
for all walks of grief.

39
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,075
It's very powerful
when all that trauma comes together.

40
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,438
It should be a really good time.

41
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,203
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

42
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:04,048
I don't think that guy would know
a good time if it fucked him in...

43
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:08,540
<font color="6d6d6d">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#f7f4f4">reggielist</font>
<font color="6d6d6d">www.addic7ed.com</font>

44
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,980
I do think it'd be good for you
to participate a little this weekend.

45
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:13,758
- Oh!
- Lean in.

46
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:16,434
You know? So you're not
just numbing your pain.

47
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,594
Pain?

48
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,848
There's no pain with this guy.

49
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,641
No, all joy.

50
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,477
Ooh! I think I'm gonna go to...

51
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,648
"Lost Angels: Finding Yourself
After Pregnancy Loss" at noon.

52
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:31,283
Wait. You could check out
"Window to the Widow."

53
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:35,822
Okay. No. I came here to escape,
not wallow in my widowhood.

54
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,927
- Hey, ladies.
- Hi.

55
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:39,668
- Got something for you.
- What?

56
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,995
- Here you go.
- Oh, my God, Yolanda.

57
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,779
Look at this.

58
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:45,322
- Isn't it great?
- It's great.

59
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,456
And voila.

60
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,916
Nice.

61
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,378
So, any tips for the weekend?

62
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,464
Well, I always get a lot out
of "Cooking for One with Chef Sue."

63
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,967
That sounds like a goofy class.

64
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,136
Hey, you coming to WTTW?

65
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,470
I have no idea what that is.

66
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,634
- Window to the Wid...
- No.

67
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,849
Window to the Widow.

68
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,776
"This workshop is focused on keeping
the window to the widow's heart

69
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,690
open to the love she shared
with the departed."

70
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,484
- Love is eternal.
- Yeah. Not if the fucker cheated.

71
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,570
Now, that's different.

72
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,322
Yeah. It's different.

73
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,867
I swear to God, I think these people
actually get off on their grief.

74
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,122
Well, maybe they're just embracing
where they are.

75
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:25,955
Well, you know, where I am
is ready to move on.

76
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:30,043
You know what? There's some
really fun gay bars downtown.

77
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:33,046
We could go dancing,
get completely ignored.

78
00:03:33,397 --> 00:03:34,881
It could be super fun.

79
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,964
Maybe.

80
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,309
But there's also lot of fun stuff
to do here.

81
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,147
Hmm.

82
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,138
I see one fun thing I can do.

83
00:03:43,982 --> 00:03:45,975
Oh, my God, I see that, too.

84
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,437
But according to the brochure,
this is a time of healing

85
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:50,879
and self-exploration.

86
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,901
Okay. Well, according to my husband,
I was dead and we weren't married.

87
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,446
So that means that somebody
is open for business.

88
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,199
And that somebody's business
is her vagina.

89
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,283
Pussy!

90
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,960
I thought you were gonna say "poontang."

91
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,913
- Ew! I would not say that.
- You might say that.

92
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,789
- Really?
- Yeah, poontang.

93
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:10,215
Hmm. Hmm.

94
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,293
Vegas Chapter.

95
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,711
- Hi.
- He's from Vegas.

96
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,173
- Widow.
- Jeez!

97
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,050
Okay. So my baby seminar

98
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,719
- is in the Desert Winds Ballroom.
- Mm-hm.

99
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,972
- Then I'll meet you after?
- Yeah. Totally.

100
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,682
- Am I okay to leave you?
- Uh-huh.

101
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,393
Judy, I'm not the one
who can't be left alone.

102
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,602
Well, that's true.

103
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,896
Yeah. Oh! Dude from the pool.

104
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,940
- Dude from the pool. Hi!
- What is going on?

105
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:35,491
Hi. Hi.

106
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,566
Hi.

107
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,528
- Nice shirt.
- Oh!

108
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,747
How embarrassing,
we all wore the same thing.

109
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,532
Yeah. Maybe I should do that to mine.

110
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,908
Yeah, maybe you should.

111
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,369
You're going to The Big Question?

112
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,748
Oh, yeah, no question about it.

113
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,376
- Should I save you a seat?
- Yeah.

114
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,170
Okay. Cool.

115
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,057
- What?
- Holy eye contact that just happened.

116
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,135
Oh, my God, how did you do that?

117
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,887
- This is gonna be really good for you.
- I know.

118
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,014
Don't bring the drink in.

119
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,766
Out of respect for the other grievers,
especially the cute one.

120
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,528
- He's very hot. I'll see you later.
- Oh, my God, super hot.

121
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,655
- I'm taking the...
- He's like a good old-fashion hunk.

122
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,066
Have fun at your baby thing...
Oh, that's not fun, is it?

123
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,359
Excuse me.

124
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,406
Hi. Oh, boy. Oh, boy, boy. You know?

125
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,075
- Go!
- I'm going.

126
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,832
Welcome to The Big Question.

127
00:05:33,965 --> 00:05:36,470
Actually... there's 14.

128
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,494
- Oh, Jesus.
- We'll break down questions

129
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:39,922
that have no easy answer.

130
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,257
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

131
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,760
Is screaming into my pillow healthy?

132
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,722
Why can't I stop eating?

133
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:50,767
So, who died and sent you here?

134
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,352
When will I run out of tears?

135
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,435
Wow!

136
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,189
Do you say that to all the widowers?

137
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,857
I might.

138
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,318
Depends on how well our
conversation goes.

139
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,527
How can I smile?

140
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,029
My wife died.

141
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,531
Sailing accident.

142
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,449
Boats.

143
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,068
Why do I feel guilty if I laugh?

144
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:11,579
My husband was in a hit-and-run.

145
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,300
- How do I think about...
- I'm Jen.

146
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:17,085
- Jason.
- Oh, hi. Jen.

147
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,094
Jason. Are you...?

148
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:21,713
You said that already. Huh?

149
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:24,572
- Does trauma last forever?
- Are you drunk?

150
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,552
Could be.

151
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,471
What? Sorry!

152
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,392
Does trauma last forever? Maybe.

153
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,559
I know him.

154
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,122
- He your pastor?
- Oh, God, no.

155
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:40,646
Ew!

156
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:43,111
The road was fraught. It was.

157
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,531
Not just to get pregnant,
but to stay pregnant.

158
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,637
And as much as we wanted
a child to embody

159
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:51,735
the love that we felt for each other,

160
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,580
the struggle to have a baby
almost tore us apart.

161
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,914
I wonder if any of you experienced that?

162
00:06:57,156 --> 00:06:58,868
I have. Hi, I'm Judy.

163
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Um...

164
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,889
My relationship
didn't survive the struggle.

165
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,341
And it's not that I really wanna
even be with him, exactly, I just...

166
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,219
I don't wanna sit in
these feelings alone.

167
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,846
That was a rhetorical question.

168
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,180
Oh.

169
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,307
Oh. I'm sorry.

170
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,891
Um...

171
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,670
I thought everybody was sharing.

172
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,772
- I'm just gonna keep going.
- Yeah! Thanks.

173
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,686
After IVF, IUI, PGD...

174
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:23,811
I did all of those.

175
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:26,654
...our doctor told us that maybe
we were having a run of bad luck.

176
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,741
Bad luck? Luck felt like
such an insufficient word.

177
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,871
And just when it seemed like
our heartbreak would destroy us,

178
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,041
we tried one last time.
And what do you know?

179
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,877
Our luck changed.

180
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,381
Oh, my God!

181
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,050
Your luck can change, too.

182
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,553
But you need to stop with the self-talk

183
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,972
that says there's something wrong
with you, with your body.

184
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,682
Stop shaming yourself.

185
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,601
Repeat after me.

186
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,394
I am not broken.

187
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,438
I am not broken.

188
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,646
Join hands.

189
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,983
Say it again.

190
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,569
Now you can talk. Okay?

191
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,113
I am not broken.

192
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,944
I am not broken.

193
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:14,118
- Say until you believe it.
- I am not broken.

194
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,183
I am not broken.

195
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:18,164
- There we go.
- I am not broken.

196
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,208
- Yes.
- I am not broken.

197
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,418
I am not broken.

198
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,420
I am not broken.

199
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,172
I am not broken.

200
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,299
Wow. That was a lot to take in.

201
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:32,011
Yeah. Pastor Wayne has a way of saying
things without saying anything.

202
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,347
- I don't know.
- He just goes on and on

203
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,015
about how you can have your feelings,

204
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:40,603
but I just think he wants you to
stay sad, like, wallow in it all.

205
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,022
It's good for his business.

206
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:48,110
I actually was in his grief group,
and I didn't get anything out of it.

207
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:49,405
Hey, Jen.

208
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,322
Hi.

209
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,123
I think you get out of it
what you put into it.

210
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,162
But what do I know?

211
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,560
- Oh, shit!
- Busted!

212
00:09:02,594 --> 00:09:04,460
I know, but I wasn't lying.

213
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,889
I actually did get something out of it.

214
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:06,964
Yeah?

215
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,405
Yeah. Sometimes, it's
nice to know you're

216
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:10,215
not the only one who
asks dumb questions.

217
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,300
- Right.
- You know?

218
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,636
Well, I'm glad you got
something out of it.

219
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,430
Do you wanna get a drink?

220
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,934
Just... I happen to know that this place
has margaritas

221
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,020
that are mediocre yet very effective.

222
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,898
I can't. I'm sorry.

223
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,942
I already signed up for Man-to-Man Yoga.

224
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,777
Oh, that sounds gay.

225
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,487
Uh. Not in a bad way.

226
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,155
Sorry, just in, like, a...

227
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,700
Are you gay... way?

228
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,993
No. I'm not.

229
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,494
- Oh.
- It's "man-to-man."

230
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,955
Oh, it's not "man-in-man."

231
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,125
- No.
- I heard "man-in-man."

232
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,294
- No.
- That's why I said that.

233
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,670
That's a different class.

234
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,338
- No, man to man.
- Okay.

235
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,716
Men are less flexible,
physically and emotionally.

236
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,301
It's supposed to work both angles.

237
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,678
- Got it.
- But I'll probably see you around.

238
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,098
Maybe at the bar for
Carry-On-Oke or something.

239
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,518
- Yeah. I was planning on going to that.
- Okay.

240
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,271

offended you earlier today.

of my mouth, and it was like...

297
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:15,171
- really, like, awkward.
- Oh, no, no, no.

298

to make jokes and...

299

- No, no, no, it's totally fine. Yeah.
- No? Okay.

300

I think it was my, um... lame attempt
to try and flirt with you.

301
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:32,460
Uh... but I haven't flirted with anyone
since my husband died.

302
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:35,972
I think I'm admitting
that 'cause I'm a little drunk.

303
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,673
- Again?
- Still.

304
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,554

would wanna flirt with me.

You were really good.

00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,766
I love that song.

353
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,518
Thanks.

354
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,980
It's nice of you to say so.

355
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,431
I think it's really refreshing

356
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:26,093
that you put yourself
out there like that,

357
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,696
and you wear your heart on your sleeve.

358
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,033
It's refreshing that you
would come and tell me that.

359
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:39,538
Well, I wasn't planning on
talking to anybody, but then,

360
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:43,711
I don't know, I just wanted
to tell you that that really moved me.

361
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,878
That really got me.

362
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,840
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

363
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,345
And you have such a great beard.

364
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,393
Are you... are you hitting on me?

365
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,772
Do you want me to be hitting on you?

366
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,775
Yeah. I'd like that.

367
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:08,915
Then that is what I'm doing.

368
00:17:09,543 --> 00:17:10,712
Probably.

369
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,285
Take off your shirt.

370
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,334
Oh, yeah.

371
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,045
That's just...

372
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,672
You are in amazing shape.

373
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,048
Hmm. Thanks.

374
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,260
When my wife fell off the boat,
I wasn't strong enough to save her.

375
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,343
Okay.

376
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,846
You know what?

377
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,894
Let's just...
Let's just try not talking, okay?

378
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,481
She reached out for me and I...

379
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,316
I couldn't pull her up.

380
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:48,431
Okay.

381
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:51,028
I promised her memory
that I would never be weak again.

382
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,947
But what does it matter?

383
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,826
She's never coming back.

384
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:03,238
I'm sorry.

385
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,084
I'm sorry.

386
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,337
I became obsessed with lifting.

387
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,826
And then my diet.
I live a life of total deprivation.

388
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,592
I deny myself so much.

389
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,927
Yeah.

390
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,596
Have you seen my purse?

391
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,679
I'm sorry.

392
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:21,016
You should probably go.

393
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,560
Yeah, I know.
That's why I'm looking for my purse.

394
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:35,384
- Hi.
- Hi.

395
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,742
- How did it go?
- Oh, it didn't.

396
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,452
Can I come in, please?

397
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,163
Uh... I'm kind of hanging out with Nick.

398
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,706
Who's Nick?

399
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,670
- Um...
- I thought you were gonna focus on you.

400
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,504
Oh, I am. But he would
also like to focus on me.

401
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,673
Mm-hm. Got it.

402
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,093
I'm not really prepared, though.

403
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,805
- Prepared how?
- Downstairs. My poontang.

404
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,182
You said "poontang."

405
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,889
I did. I know.

406
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:05,444
- It's not sexy, right?
- It's a gross word.

407
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,764
- Don't say it in there?
- No.

408
00:19:07,374 --> 00:19:09,773
So what kind of landscape
are we talking?

409
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,150
Oh, it's lush.

410
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,233
Oh.

411
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,027
Just lean in, baby.

412
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,154
- Really?
- Yeah.

413
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,489
Thank you.

414
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:21,064
- Can I take the room for a minute?
- Mm-hm.

415
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:22,328
I mean, I probably need
more than a minute.

416
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,611
Okay. I got it.

417
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,622
- Be careful.
- Okay.

418
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,456
Yuck!

419
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,533
Wow.

420
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,912
This is not how I was expecting
the weekend to go.

421
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,163
Me either.

422
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,665
Um...

423
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,044
Okay.

424
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:18,008
If it's cool, I just...
I'd like to take it slow.

425
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,322
I want you to like me in the morning.

426
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,554
Oh, my God. That's so sweet.

427
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,308
It's not a line. I'm not a player.

428
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:28,317
You have very healthy boundaries.

429
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,729
- You think it's nerdy?
- No, I think it's sexy.

430
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:37,433
Okay, but when you say slow,
like, define slow.

431
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,404
We have to define it?

432
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,122
Well, I mean,
do you mean, like, just kissing,

433
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,785
or do you mean, like, everything but?

434
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,122
Well... my job,

435
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,503
it requires that I be very deliberate,

436
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,758
that I take my time, that I be thorough,

437
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,887
and then I satisfy everyone I serve.

438
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,848
How seriously do you take your job?

439
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,229
Oh!

440
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,398
Natural woman.

441
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,650
You're welcome.

442
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,492
Nice night, huh?

443
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,868
Oh, Jesus.

444
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,121
You got to stop
sneaking up on me like that.

445
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,709
Sorry. I was just looking
for someplace to be alone.

446
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,542
Just need to unwind a bit.

447
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,294
Yeah. Me too.

448
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,046
- You know what? Why don't I just...?
- No, it's okay.

449
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,382
It's okay.

450
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,510
We can... be alone together.

451
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,431
Do you mind if I smoke?

452
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,015
No.

453
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,142
Mind if I drink?

454
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,478
Look at you.

455
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,940
You mind sharing?

456
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,360
You're an artist.

457
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,488
Hmm, not really. I
just paint for myself.

458
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,125
- Did you paint that little girl?
- Yeah.

459
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,494
Then you're an artist.

460
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,819
You don't think they're creepy?

461
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,498
Um... I do.

462
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,792
But they're also beautiful.

463
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,422
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

464
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,885
So tell me about your friend.

465
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,346
The one that you dedicated the song to.

466
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,931
- Lucas.
- Yeah. Lucas.

467
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,143
Yeah. Well...

468
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,019
we...

469
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,314
worked together. We were partners.

470
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,483
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

471
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,153
I don't know
what it's like to be a widower,

472
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,905
or to lose a kid, but...

473
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,608
I definitely know
what it's like to lose a best friend.

474
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,371
- It sucks.
- Yeah. That would be really hard.

475
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,415
I haven't even been back
to work since he died.

476
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,251
How did it happen?

477
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,628
On duty.

478
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,298
I'm sorry...

479
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,051
what is it that you do?

480
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,970
I wanna apologize
for what I said earlier.

481
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,224
I know you think I'm a dick.

482
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,018
- Not at all.
- A little.

483
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,270
Maybe a little.

484
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,607
I'm sorry. I...

485
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,943
I know you mean well.

486
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,446
Like, I know you don't take
the work seriously,

487
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,031
or me seriously.

488
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,118
- Look, don't take it personally.
- I don't.

489
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:35,163
Yeah. I know you use cynicism
as a way to deal with grief.

490
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,372
You're not the first.

491
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,626
No. But I am the best.

492
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,711
Oh, yeah. You've raised the bar.

493
00:23:41,844 --> 00:23:44,430
Ah! It's good to be appreciated.

494
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,175
I do appreciate you.

495
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,603
He was... he was cheating on me.

496
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,730
My husband.

497
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,648
Before he died.

498
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,525
I just found out.

499
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,530
I'm so sorry.

500
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,740
Yeah. Me too.

501
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,788
How does knowing that make you feel?

502
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,005
Like I hate him.

503
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,594
That seems right.

504
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,472
I don't want to hate him.

505
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,392
I don't want to feel
any of this shit anymore.

506
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,351
Jen...

507
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:40,556
I know...

508
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:43,979
I'm supposed to forgive him
because that's the way through, and...

509
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,194
Look, see, I... I listen.

510
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,780
I just don't like to apply it.

511
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,626
Maybe you can't forgive him for dying.

512
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,541
- He didn't mean to die.
- Fair.

513
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:05,045
But you don't know
how your story was gonna end,

514
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,298
and someone just ripped
those pages out of your book.

515
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,008
Right.

516
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,846
Maybe he was gonna
tell you or apologize.

517
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,597
Or leave me.

518
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,142
He did leave you.

519
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:23,858
Yeah.

520
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,108
Believe it or not, what I'm hearing...

521
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,612
is that you really loved him.

522
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,452
Yeah.

523
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:42,828
Yeah.

524
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,713
Do you have any cigarettes?

525
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,006
No.

526
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,482
Oh, shoot.

527
00:26:08,573 --> 00:26:10,033
Oh!

528
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:19,953
Oh, my God...

529
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,151
Hi.

530
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,446
Hi.

531
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:57,781
Are you okay?

532
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,369
No.

533
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,081
How was your night?

534
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,252
Um, it was... maybe better than yours?

535
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,549
I need to get my shit together, Judy.

536
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,594
- Okay.
- For my boys.

537
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,179
Okay.

538
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,683
But there's no escaping it. It's just...

539
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,813
It's, like, wherever you go,
there you are. You know?

540
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,024
Yeah.

541
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,529
Which just... sucks.

542
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,285
I wish you didn't feel like that.

543
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,745
Well, I do.

544
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,501
Because someone ripped my life apart.

545
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,215
I hate that person.

546
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,351
Hi.

547
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,144
Hey.

548
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,373
This is my friend, Jen.

549
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,653
I usually look a little
better than this.

550
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,113
Hello, friend.

551
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,864
This is Nick.

552
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:22,742
Hi, Nick.

553
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:30,833
He's a cop.

554
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,797
A detective, actually.

555
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,222
You ever solve a hit-and-run?

556
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,226
Yes.
