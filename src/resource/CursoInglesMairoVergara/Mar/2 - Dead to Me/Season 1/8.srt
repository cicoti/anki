00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:16,641
Hi! Jen Harding. Real estate agent.

2
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,057
I just sold a house in the area for

3
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:21,763
two million, all cash. Blah, blah, blah!

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,734
Anyway, I just wanted you to know
how valuable your property is.

5
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,445
I mean, especially
with this curb appeal.

6
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,323
Oh. Well, I'm not looking to sell.

7
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,410
Oh. Well, you might change your mind
if I do an appraisal,

8
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,328
which should only take a few minutes.

9
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,248
I mean, unless you're busy
or you just hate money.

10
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,624
Well...

11
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,298
Is this ethical?

12
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,341
Harassing people
because they're on a list?

13
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,427
It's not unethical.

14
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,987
We're not hurting anybody,

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,222
just tracking down people
who own vintage Mustangs.

16
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:01,533
Right. But, like, historically,
lists have been bad for people, right?

17
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,702
- Like the blacklist.
- This list is only bad for

18
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:06,775
- the person who killed Jen's husband.
- Right. Yeah.

19
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,985
And there have been some
good lists, historically.

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,529
- Schindler's list. Great list.
- Yeah.

21
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,033
It was really... That
was a beautiful list.

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,158
Uh-huh.

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,412
But is it legal, what we're doing?

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,816
My buddy Dennis at the NCIC can share

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,826
information with government agencies.

26
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,255
Now, would Laguna PD consider me
a government agency? Hell, no.

27
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,302
- Come on. This is fun, right?
- Well, it is so fun.

28
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,514
I haven't felt this good in months.

29
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,389
Honestly.

30
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,143
Being here with you, working a case.

31
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,354
It's bringing me back to life.

32
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,064
So, thank you.

33
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,899
You're welcome.

34
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,492
So, it's about 1,500 square feet?

35
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,370
No idea.
I inherited the house from my aunt.

36
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,164
- She's in a home now, so...
- Great. Can I see the garage?

37
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,626
Oh! Is this a '66 Mustang?

38
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,089
Yeah, but, um... the car
doesn't like, come with the house.

39
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,174
You ever hit anybody with this thing?

40
00:02:18,256 --> 00:02:20,334
<font color="6d6d6d">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#f7f4f4">reggielist</font>
<font color="6d6d6d">www.addic7ed.com</font>

41
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,059
Oh!

42
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,351
Okay.

43
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:28,439
Cross that one off the list.
He was on a Star Trek cruise that week.

44
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,817
I saw so many pictures I wish I hadn't.

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,444
All right. Six down. 242 to go.

46
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,938
My God. I can't believe
the fucker who did

47
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:36,790
this is one of these names on this list.

48
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,950
God, it's gonna feel so good
to look him in the eye

49
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:40,984
and tell him
what a spineless monster he is

50
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:43,859
and then beat the shit out of him.
All right. Who's next?

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,298
Okay. Beachside Antiques.
Deerfield Road.

52
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,417
Business? Weird.

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,544
Yeah. Could be a company
car, or rentals.

54
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:53,256
Bunch of businesses on here.
Move Ur Car Ur Way, Pelican Vintage.

55
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,134
- TKG Arts.
- Who the fuck is TKG Arts?

56
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,804
- Can I see that?
- Yeah. You all right?

57
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,052
Yeah, it's just, like,

58
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:03,729
- stuffy in here. Right?
- Oh.

59
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,063
Okay. These businesses are all downtown.

60
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:13,284
So why don't you guys drop me off
and then I'll check these out?

61
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,999
- Hmm.
- Safer if we stick together.

62
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,779
Yeah, right? All right.

63
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,032
I need a name, Judy. Mama's on a roll.

64
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,701
- Okay.
- Yup.

65
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,953
Heather Dornan.

66
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,164
Uh... She lives in Costa Mesa.

67
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,459
Seven-two-eight Bristol Street.

68
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,254
A woman. Wow.

69
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,796
That surprise you?

70
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,508
I just never pictured
a woman driving the car.

71
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,760
What kind of feminist am I?

72
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,512
Oh, women can be murderers too.

73
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,299
I know. I saw that
Charlize Theron movie.

74
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,342
Which one?

75
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:46,892
Uh-huh!

76
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,660
The route is being calculated.

77
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:50,915
Wait, you know what?
I need a bottle of water.

78
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:52,616
- Oh. Sure.
- Can you pop the trunk?

79
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,649
Okay.

80
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,194
All right?

81
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,988
God, there's just
so many names on this list.

82
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,512
I wish that we could narrow it down
somehow and find this guy.

83
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,534
- Or gal.
- Oh, right.

84
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,994
- Mm-hm.
- God, I'm such a dick.

85
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,246
Yup.

86
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,499
What was that?

87
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,458
Jude?

88
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
Judy?

89
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,214
Oh, come on. I'm fine.

90
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,632
I faint all the time.

91
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:19,008
No, you don't.

92
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,386
Yeah. You haven't known
me for that long.

93
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,305
I did it a bunch in high school
and then once at Lilith Fair.

94
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,306
Remember Lilith Fair?

95
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,393
No, I was way too high.

96
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,019
Of course you were.

97
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,312
- It was fun.
- Okay.

98
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,023
Nobody get too excited,
but Dennis just called.

99
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,775
He crosschecked our list against DUls.

100
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,027
- And?
- Something interesting.

101
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,573
Andrew Peters. Two DUls.
Lives four blocks from the scene.

102
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,825
Andrew Peters.

103
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:46,152
- That's the fucking guy.
- See? That's too excited.

104
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,308
No, no! We should go
check it out, right?

105
00:04:48,342 --> 00:04:49,368
Yeah.

106
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:51,541
- Yes, we should. Let's go.
- Okay. Let's go.

107
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,418
But, oh, sit back.

108
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,170
I'm sorry. I feel so woozy.

109
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,854
Let's chill for a minute.
We can't jump to conclusions here, okay?

110
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,062
I'm not jumping to anything.

111
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:03,252
I'm just saying it's a '66
Mustang with two DUls

112
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,180
and lives four blocks from where Ted
was hit. That's the fucking guy.

113
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,264
It's pretty compelling.

114
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,502
- I like him for it.
- I like him too.

115
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,720
We should call Detective Perez,
we should loop her in.

116
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,245
Oh, no. I'm not calling her.

117
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,104
She's gonna slow us down
with her "process."

118
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,096
Hey, I get it, okay?
But we can't run away with this thing.

119
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,778
Nobody here has a badge, currently.

120
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:22,154
Yeah, maybe he's right.

121
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,741
Maybe we should just,
you know, slow it down.

122
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,701
Okay. Yeah, maybe you're right.

123
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,703
- You got to trust me.
- I trust you.

124
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,475
Oh, gosh. You guys, you know what?
I'm late to pick up Charlie.

125
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,541
- Uh... Will you keep an eye on her?
- Yeah.

126
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,334
I'd love to.

127
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,977
A little hot tea,
a little chicken soup from a can.

128
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,354
Don't tell my mama.

129
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,188
Oh...

130
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,941
- Ugh! Soup smells so bad.
- Yup.

131
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,693
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

132
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:05,546
Nausea, fainting, sweats.
You thrown up at all?

133
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,824
- Yes.
- Oh.

134
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,531
You know, I'm not a doctor, but
I'd say it's either the flu...

135
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:10,593
or you're pregnant.

136
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,830
Since you and I have
been taking it slow,

137
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:14,412
which is adorable but getting harder

138
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:15,966
every day, I'd say you have the flu.

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,127
Unless you got a side piece.

140
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,470
Oh, shit.

141
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,146
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

142
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,403
You're too good to me.

143
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,279
No. It's nothing.

144
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,616
You know that feeling you get
when a thing is new,

145
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:53,621
and the person you're into gets sick,
or there's an emergency,

146
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,166
it makes you realize, wow,
how much you care about them?

147
00:06:57,377 --> 00:07:00,253
Even though it hasn't been that long?
Do I sound like an idiot?

148
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,336
No.

149
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,757
You're such a great guy.

150
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,095
Oh, shit.

151
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,056
"You're such a great guy"?
Were you about to say, "But?"

152
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,558
No.

153
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,101
Yeah, yeah, yes, yes.

154
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,519
Yes, I am.

155
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,443
Honestly, before I met you,
I was engaged to someone.

156
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,485
Okay.

157
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:28,698
And he has suddenly
come back into the picture.

158
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,201
And I don't wanna have
feelings for him, but I do.

159
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,705
And I don't think that it's fair to you.

160
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,457
Okay.

161
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,710
I'm so sorry. I...

162
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,920
Steve and I are just
hot and cold, you know?

163
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,403
Sometimes, I hate him and then

164
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:46,515
the next minute,
it's the most passionate...

165
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:48,684
- Yeah, I don't need the play-by-play.
- Right.

166
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,886
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,889
Should I...

168
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,516
- You okay?
- I'm gonna go.

169
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,020
Yeah, sure. You don't have to stay
and take care of me.

170
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,190
- Yeah. It's a little awkward right now.
- Yeah, I guess.

171
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,153
Thank you, though. For everything.

172
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,658
I did not see this coming.

173
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,453
Some detective, huh?

174
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,794
Shit.

175
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,352
Hi. Jen Harding.

176
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:50,736
Uh, I was just driving back from another

177
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,357
listing and I had to stop because, wow!

178
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,243
What a house! I mean...

179
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,870
is there any possibility
you're interested in selling?

180
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,123
Because prices are just insane
in this area right now.

181
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,001
Really? All right. I'm interested.

182
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,961
Andrew.

183
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,587
Peters.

184
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,005
Pleasure.

185
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,260
- Please. Come on in.
- Thanks.

186
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,976
Wow. It's beautiful.

187
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,520
I love the minimalism.

188
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,063
So... sleek.

189
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,146
Thanks.

190
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,983
The ex-wife hated it.

191
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,443
Oh. Well, then I hate her.

192
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,406
- All right.
- All right.

193
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,033
Can I get you a drink?

194
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,663
Um... No. No, I shouldn't.
I'm on the clock.

195
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,665
- Mind if I hit it?
- Sure.

196
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,503
I made that myself.

197
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,588
It's mahogany.

198
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,383
Hmm. That's a quality wood.

199
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,970
Got a whole workroom
set up in my garage.

200
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,057
Never met a time-sucking hobby
I couldn't get behind.

201
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,685
Well, I'd love to see more of your work.

202
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,606
Oh, yeah. I don't know.
The garage is kind of a mess.

203
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,525
- I can handle a little dust.
- I'd rather not.

204
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,404
You know...

205
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,488
screw it. I...

206
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,617
I will have that drink.

207
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,825
Oh!

208
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,578
All right. It's a party.

209
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,123
- Touch of the brown stuff?
- Mm-hm.

210
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,630
Here we are.

211
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,965
That'll warm you up.

212
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,674
Thanks.

213
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,887
- Is it this way?
- Yeah. Right through that door.

214
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,848
Hmm.

215
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,935
This... wood is really...

216
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,607
Circles, uh... really honor the wood.

217
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,609
You are too kind.

218
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,488
Is this a '66 Mustang?

219
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,032
Yes, it is. Good for you.

220
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,451
You a car buff?

221
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,162
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Mmm.

222
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,918
- You mind if...
- Oh, God. Yeah.

223
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,714
Et voilà!

224
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,177
Another one of my projects.

225
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,681
- Wanna check it out?
- Hmm?

226
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,641
- Go on. Jump in.
- Oh.

227
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,060
- All new interior. Just restored it.
- Okay.

228
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,730
Should have seen it three months ago.
It was a wreck.

229
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Fingers and toes.

230
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,820
Why are the tires off?
Did something happen?

231
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,073
Nothing happened. That's the problem.

232
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,534
It's taken me fucking forever
to put this thing together.

233
00:11:44,116 --> 00:11:45,913
So you've... you've never driven it?

234
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,996
Not yet.

235
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,877
You would not believe how vicious
these car collectors are on eBay.

236
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,548
Fucking jackals. Anyway, check this out.

237
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,013
May not have an engine yet
but my stereo is hot.

238
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,891
You know, I should probably get going.
It's late.

239
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,685
- Whoa!
- Uh...

240
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,485
- Hey.
- Can you let me out?

241
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,739
- Easy. Be gentle with it.
- I'm getting claustrophobic.

242
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,191
- Please just...
- Let me help you out a little there.

243
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,276
Okay.

244
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,778
- God, you smell so good.
- No. That's not what this is.

245
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,156
- Get off of me.
- No. Relax, it's fine.

246
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,907
Get the fuck off me!

247
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,288
Bitch! What the fuck is wrong with you?

248
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,206
No means motherfucking no.

249
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,875
Get the fuck out of my house!

250
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,379
Fucking blood everywhere. You bitch!

251
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,970
Hey, girl.

252
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,598
Oh, Judy. Hey, girl.

253
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,016
Girl, he's on a call.

254
00:12:47,106 --> 00:12:48,986
Some people think it's for pussies,
but I don't.

255
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,021
No. I said I don't think
it's for pussies.

256
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,273
Yeah, I got to go too. Bye.

257
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,484
- Hi.
- Hey.

258
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,834
Uh... What's going on?
Things are chaotic right now.

259
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:00,103
I don't have time to...

260
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,009
I have to talk to you
about a couple of things.

261
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:04,417
Juds, honestly, I got a meeting in five
minutes. If this can wait...

262
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,701
- It can't.
- Okay.

263
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,052
I broke up with the guy that I'm seeing.

264
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,372
- Okay.
- Because he's not you.

265
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,874
It's a high bar.

266
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,419
And because...

267
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,589
I think I might be pregnant.

268
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,009
- Fuck! Seriously?
- Yeah.

269
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,137
- How do you know it's mine?
- I never slept with him!

270
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,305
That's weird.

271
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,223
It's yours.

272
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:31,567
- Judy, now? This is happening now?
- Yes, I know.

273
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,136
But after everything we've been through,

274
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:34,992
maybe we're finally getting
what we wanted.

275
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,107
We get to have our family.

276
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,987
I know it's scary, but sometimes
things happen in weird ways, right?

277
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,071
Hmm.

278
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,198
Judy...

279
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:47,880
this is not divine intervention, okay?

280
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:49,295
This is the definition of insanity,

281
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,089
doing the same thing over and over again
hoping for a different result.

282
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,874
- We know the result.
- No, we don't.

283
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,248
- We don't know the result.
- We lived the result five times.

284
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:57,470
Well maybe our luck has changed.

285
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,383
Would you stop fucking
bright-siding everything?

286
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,631
- Don't yell at me.
- Sorry.

287
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,714
It's okay.

288
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,930
Look, I can't put myself
through this again.

289
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:09,939
I just can't. I'm sorry.

290
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,018
You can call me in nine months if it...
You know?

291
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,271
Or maybe just put yourself
out of your misery now.

292
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,942
Put myself out of my misery?

293
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:23,738
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, babe.

294
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:27,491
I got the sush.
Oh, my bad. I didn't mean to interrupt.

295
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:29,361
Hey babe.. I'm just finishing
up with a client.

296
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:30,422
Oh.

297
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,663
Sorry. I was in the bathroom.

298
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,290
- Hey, girl.
- Hey, girl.

299
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,693
Girl.

300
00:14:35,727 --> 00:14:37,760
Uh Kaley, would you taking Heidi
to the break room?

301
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,353
- I'm just gonna be a sec. Okay.
- Sure.

302
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,554
What? You were seeing someone.

303
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,017
What?

304
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:57,488
Wait, what was the other thing
you wanted to say?

305
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,898
What?

306
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,775
You said a couple of things.

307
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,693
What else?

308
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,290
Nothing.

309
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:03,878
Okay, okay.

310
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,132
Hey.

311
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,396
You just went straight to Steve?
You didn't even take a test yet?

312
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,764
I did. I didn't have one.

313
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,475
But I just know because
my boobs are so tender.

314
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,644
All right. Stop staring at it, okay?

315
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,272
A watched pee stick
never turns positive.

316
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,237
Do you want it to be positive
or do you not?

317
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,238
I do.

318
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:32,716
- You do? Okay.
- Oh, God, I do want it to be positive.

319
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,943
But, you know, sometimes
when you really want something

320
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,194
and you think if you hope for it,
it's not gonna happen?

321
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,331
And if you don't hope for it,
maybe it will happen?

322
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,667
- Mm-hm.
- But sometimes when you hope for things

323
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,750
they happen, right?

324
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,045
So maybe I just...

325
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,465
hope for the next three minutes.

326
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,731
Okay.

327
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:53,887
So you're gonna let yourself feel
how you actually feel.

328
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,221
That's a good idea.

329
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,057
Yeah. Thanks.

330
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,973
But you are not allowed to feel positive

331
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:02,387
feelings towards Steve ever again.

332
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,648
Even if that's how you actually feel.

333
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,066
No, I won't. I can't.

334
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,444
Okay. Because, you know,
you've gone back before.

335
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,447
You are an addict. And he's meth...

336
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,407
with impish good looks.

337
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,742
Oh, God, he is.

338
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,745
I hate his stupid fucking face.

339
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,873
Okay. It's been two minutes. So, avert.

340
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,666
Just don't. Don't do it...

341
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,501
- I really wanna look at it.
- Don't do it.

342
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,468
Oh, I broke up with Nick.

343
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,552
You did?

344
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,013
- Yeah.
- Oh!

345
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,849
I know. He deserves
someone nicer than me.

346
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,768
Who the fuck is nicer than you?

347
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,896
Okay. Then maybe someone more stable.

348
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,273
Well, that he can maybe find.

349
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,945
Maybe it's not great
to be a single mom that's not stable.

350
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,490
Whose mother is stable?

351
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,326
And you won't be a single mom.

352
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,494
You have me.

353
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,749
We can be like
a three-child mothering team.

354
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,835
- Mothering team.
- Aww!

355
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,128
That's awesome!

356
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,815
Oh, shit.

357
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,646
It's okay.

358
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,112
You only see one line, right?

359
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,445
Yeah.

360
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,073
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,244
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,494
It's okay.

363
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,121
It's okay.

364
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,629
Well...

365
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,174
you're probably not ready to hear this,
but...

366
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,386
one tiny bit of a bright side.

367
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,054
What?

368
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,849
You can drink.

369
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:04,726
Yeah, I can drink.

370
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,231
I just got out of there
as fast as I could.

371
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,994
Oh, my God! Fucking piece of shit.

372
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:15,362
Yeah, but it's, like, you know,
I went into the house.

373
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,739
- I got into the car.
- No, stop it.

374
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,825
You're being, like, I asked for it.

375
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:23,245
No, I know I wasn't... asking for it.
It's just...

376
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,541
I'm pretty sure I broke his face,
so that feels good.

377
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,044
Wow! That's awesome!
You are a tough broad.

378
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,065
Hardly.

379
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,964
You are.

380
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,342
You're "don't mess
with Texas," you know.

381
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,509
What?

382
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,847
Uh, am I Texas in that equation or...?

383
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,849
Well, you're like Brooklyn, like,

384
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:46,163
"Don't fuck with me" - Ew.

385
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,396
Is that... is that what you think
people sound like?

386
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,469
You didn't think I was from the block
when I said it?

387
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:52,691
- No.
- What?

388
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:54,523
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, then you do it.

389
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:55,611
No, I'm not gonna do it.

390
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:56,692
- Come on.
- No.

391
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:57,749
Please?

392
00:19:57,804 --> 00:19:59,907
- Uh-uh.
- I've had a really shitty day.

393
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,462
I used to sound like this.

394
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,490
Like this.

395
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,539
I love it so much!

396
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,291
You're lucky you're sad.

397
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,383
I shouldn't have let you
go to that guy's house.

398
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,816
You didn't let me go.

399
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,424
I just went.

400
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,762
But you can't do that anymore.

401
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,139
You can't go to strangers' houses.
It's not safe.

402
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,516
- Okay? You have to stop. I mean it.
- I know.

403
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,018
Yeah, I mean it too.

404
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,646
Detective Perez called
and said if I don't stop,

405
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,106
- they'll throw me in jail or something.
- What?

406
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,273
Mm-hm.

407
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,401
Yeah. That's the world we're living in.

408
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,322
I get assaulted and then I get in
trouble and a criminal walks free.

409
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,660
God, I just wish it was him.

410
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,454
Yeah. Me too.

411
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,877
I know you think that if you find
the person who did this,

412
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,504
it's gonna make you feel better.

413
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,717
I really don't think it will.

414
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,729
I guess I just wanted my
fucking three minutes of hope.

415
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,484
But no.

416
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,277
Yeah.

417
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,282
Hope will burn you like that.

418
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,535
Yeah.

419
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,427
Jen!

420
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Is it?

421
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,014
Yeah, it is.

422
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,226
- It's positive now, right?
- Yeah. It is.

423
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,320
- Holy shit.
- And that's two lines, not one, right?

424
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,646
- Yes, clearly, yes.
- Clearly.

425
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,064
My God, you know what that means?

426
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,817
Yeah. That I'm the asshole
that bought you the cheap test.

427
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,140
Yeah, who buys store brand?
I thought you were my friend.

428
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,322
- Who cares? You're pregnant.
- Oh, my God!

429
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,073
You're not pregnant.

430
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,409
Sorry, what?

431
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,036
You're not pregnant.

432
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,122
Oh, no, but I...

433
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,750
In fact, your estrogen
levels are so low,

434
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,461
it'd be impossible for you
to get pregnant.

435
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,129
I'm so sorry.

436
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,341
No, but the test said
that I was pregnant.

437
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,260
Unfortunately,
if you leave it out for too long,

438
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,179
it can show false positive.

439
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,226
I don't understand. Then what are
all these symptoms that I'm having?

440
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:37,397
Those symptoms can also be indicative
of early menopause.

441
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,777
I'm so sorry.

442
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,825
Uh, yeah. I would say that
Perez's tone was firm.

443
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,076
Um...

444
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,871
The words "cease and desist" were used.

445
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,457
Ah, okay.

446
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,291
Understood.

447
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,419
I am so sorry, Nick.
I hope I didn't get you in any trouble.

448
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,964
Oh, no. No, don't worry about it.
You didn't get me in any trouble.

449
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,177
Hey. I also wanted to say sorry
about you and Judy.

450
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:11,014
Yeah. That didn't quite work out
the way I'd hoped.

451
00:23:12,776 --> 00:23:13,941
Most things don't.

452
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,769
What can you do, though?

453
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,316
Look, I love Judy, but I will be
the first to admit that she...

454
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,444
she can be a little hard to pin down.

455
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,362
Yeah.

456
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,660
Yeah.

457
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,829
I'm not.

458
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,748
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

459
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,166
And I never will be.

460
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,336
I gotta go. It's an emergency.

461
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,838
Yeah. Me too.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
