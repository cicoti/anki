1
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,353
This is delicious.

2
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,200
You wouldn't even know
it's not meat, right?

3
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,276
- Wrong.
- Char.

4
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,778
- This isn't meat?
- Nope. I can't eat this.

5
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,071
Okay. You know what?

6
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,907
You are being a jerk. We have a guest.

7
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:35,222
Is she a guest or does
she live here now?

8
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,078
Yeah. How long is Judy staying with us?

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,040
Um... Well, I don't know. It's the...

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,209
- first night, so...
- I mean, we haven't talked about it.

11
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,054
- No. We've never discussed the exact...
- I don't know. Is it like...

12
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,434
- ...time frame, but...
- I don't wanna be awkward about it.

13
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:50,592
No. Let's not be awkward, it's...

14
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,053
- Whatever you...
- Whatever you need.

15
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,138
- As long as you want it.
- As long as you want it.

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,535
- Sounds good.
- Okay?

17
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:00,029
You don't even know her.

18
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,645
You met her in some
group a few weeks ago.

19
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,106
And now she's gonna
live in Dad's studio.

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,400
- Do you know how fucked up that is?
- Okay.

21
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,988
She is sitting right here,
so you're being rude, A.

22
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,715
B, enough with the "fucks," okay?

23
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:19,287
You're 14 years old. And C, I would
never, ever put you in harm's way.

24
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,248
Okay? Everything is gonna be fine.

25
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,125
I'm an excellent judge of character.

26
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,671
Except for that one babysitter
that stole money from your evening bag.

27
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,422
Stephanie.

28
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,549
Yeah, Stephanie.

29
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,590
Okay. You know, well, Judy

30
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:35,920
is not a petty thief with
an opioid addiction.

31
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,807
- That I know of.
- No, I'm not.

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,184
But I hope that Stephanie
got the help that she needs.

33
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,393
She's dead.

34
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,728
Um...

35
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,775
Charlie, I totally get it
that it's weird that I'm here.

36
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,450
Look, you could be anybody.

37
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:51,653
I could be anybody.

38
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:53,029
She could be a crazy person.

39
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,363
So could I.

40
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,907
So could I.

42
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,420
I'm really sorry about Charlie.

43
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,257
He's just... God, he's been such
a little dick since his dad died.

44
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,601
- Oh, he's great.
- If you think he's great,

45
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,989
then you are a saint.

46
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:19,139
- Oh, he's great.
- No, I'm not a saint.

47
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,558
- You are an angel.
- Oh, please. No.

48
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,227
- You'll come find that I am the devil.
- I'm the devil.

49
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,563
I'm glad you're here.

50
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,022
Me, too.

51
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:32,256
Oh, you know what?

52
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,029
There's some fresh linens
and towels over there for you.

53
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:37,977
I... I'm sorry, I didn't
make up the bed. I just...

54
00:02:38,704 --> 00:02:40,585
haven't been able to bring myself
to go into the guesthouse since...

55
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,372
Oh, stop it. Come on. You are so nice.
I can't thank you enough.

56
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,249
- You're such a good friend.
- Oh!

57
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:48,257
Well...

58
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,794
not that good.

59
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:52,730
What?

60
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,926
Look, this... wasn't my finest moment.

61
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,468
But...

62
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,808
I gave Steve my business card
the night I found out he wasn't dead.

63
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,351
- Oh.
- And...

64
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,435
he called me,

65
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,397
and I'm selling his house.

66
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,317
- Okay.
- I'm really sorry.

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,154
But to be fair, in the moment,
I thought you were a lying psychopath.

68
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,573
- No, of course.
- Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

69
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,782
- What?
- You're bleeding.

70
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,950
Oh, God.

71
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,203
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. It's a nick.

72
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,705
- The glass chipped. Sorry.
- Okay.

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,248
Look, I just...

74
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,376
I just hope it's not gonna be weird,
me working with Steve.

75
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,545
Hmm... It's a little weird.

76
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,069
I mean, not as weird as you
lying about him being dead, but...

77
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,466
No. Right, not that weird.

78
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,259
- That was way weird.
- Yeah.

79
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:41,103
- Can I please get you a Band-Aid?
- No, I'm...

80
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,348
Because it looks like a gash,
not really a nick.

81
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,431
I'm a bleeder.

82
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,644
Everyone's a bleeder,
but that's just real... grim.

83
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,480
I just... I don't know.
I guess maybe I thought that, like,

84
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,674
I don't know, if Steve and I
would work it out or something.

85
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,406
- Do you still have feelings for him?
- No. I shouldn't.

86
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,993
You know what?
This is probably for the best, you know?

87
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:08,039
- It's gonna force you to just move on.
- Yeah.

88
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,750
But I just... That was our house.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,212
We were gonna have a family there.
And he doesn't even run it past me?

90
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,215
Well, you know what?
You can stay here as long as you want.

91
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,299
- Oh, stop.
- Okay?

92
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,675
Oh!

93
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,928
Yeah. You know, I'm gonna get

94
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,348
the first aid kit,
'cause this looks like a horror movie.

95
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,431
Thank you.

96
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,413
Oh, Jesus...

97
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,285
Oh, my God.

98
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,157
Hey! Slow down!

99
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,077
2QCE 265.

100
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:53,477
2QCE 265.

101
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,292
2QCE 265.

102
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,766
Hi, Gina. Is Steve around?

103
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:02,864
- Judy.
- Hi.

104
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,341
Haven't seen you in a while.
Steve's actually not in.

105
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,865
- Oh. Mind if I just check?
- Actually, I'm not supposed to...

106
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,097
- Judy. Hey, girl. Can I help...
- Hey, girl.

107
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,654
Sorry, girl,
but you really can't be in here.

108
00:07:19,195 --> 00:07:20,280
Girl, I know!

109
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,900
Bye, girl.

110
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,110
Bye.

111
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,322
Uh-huh. 2QCE 265.

112
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,950
He was speeding near the street
that Ted was hit,

113
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,244
so I just thought maybe
there'd be a connection there.

114
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,246
Oh, that's a stretch?

115
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:39,083
Well, maybe if you found the guy,
I wouldn't have to fucking stretch!

116
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,835
- Who we yelling at now?
- Cops.

117
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,004
Wonderful. Steve is here.

118
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,948
- Hey-o.
- Hey! There he is!

119
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,602
Christopher was just
giving me a tour of your office.

120
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,430
Nice! Love it.
It's, like, beachy but not tacky.

121
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,557
You know, it's a tough wave to surf.

122
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,100
Thank you. Have a seat.

123
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:58,978
I can't wait to take a
tour of your house.

124
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,105
I drove past it last week.

125
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,942
Goosebumps from stem to stern.
Oh, here's the exclusivity agreement.

126
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,778
Yeah, thanks. No, it's a sweet place,
definitely, but...

127
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,031
way too much room for me now.

128
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,574
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah.

129
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:12,962
Oh, hey, how's Judy?

130
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:15,075
Did you find her that night
you came looking for her?

131
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,286
I did.

132
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,664
Yes. Actually, um...

133
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,376
It was just a really
funny misunderstanding, but...

134
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,668
meant to be.

135
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:24,795
How so?

136
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,798
Well, I met you.
And now we are working together.

137
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:30,549
You have been hanging out with Judy.

138
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:32,077
Sounds like something she would say.

139
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,861
Judy's actually living with Jen now.

140
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,557
- Is she?
- Mm-hmm.

141
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,892
Yeah, in my guesthouse.

142
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,519
It's, uh, really...

143
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,313
It's nice having another adult around
after my husband died, so...

144
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,817
She needed a place to land.
And it just worked out for both of us.

145
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,236
Great. It's very kind of you.

146
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,612
You know, Judy's...

147
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,031
- She's been through a lot.
- I know. I know.

148
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,700
She's really... She's
been a rock for me.

149
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,246
Really?

150
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,872
Yeah.

151
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,082
Why?

152
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,925
Uh, look, I don't want to talk badly
about her, but uh...

153
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,131
for whatever it's worth,
let's just say wherever Judy goes,

154
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,633
chaos tends to follow.

155
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,886
- Okay.
- No, really. I wish her the best.

156
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,514
But, uh, she is, um...

157
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,102
a little nuts.

158
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:24,188
Well, that feels like new information.

159
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,088
What in the holy fuck?

160
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,509
You are free.

161
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,637
Oh, God.

162
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:02,976
Oh, boy.

163
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,269
Motherfucker!

164
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,910
- Hey!
- You threw rock at my car crazy bitch?

165
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:30,292
You could've hit someone, asshole.
Slow the fuck down.

166
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:31,672
Yeah? Make me.

167
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,215
Ew! Fuck you!

168
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:43,791
Yes, it was the same asshole, still
speeding and the fucker spit at me.

169
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,188
Mm-hmm.

170
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,276
Yes, that is the exact message
I want you to give the detective.

171
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,693
Thank you.

172
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,790
Hey.

173
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Hi.

174
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,632
Breakfast is almost ready.

175
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,593
Um, have you been sleeping outside?

176
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,929
Oh, yeah.

177
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,888
Okay.

178
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,223
Um...

179
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,559
I mean, is the guesthouse not...
Are you....

180
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,143
not...

181
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,480
- Why?
- The guesthouse is great.

182
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,482
- Okay.
- It's just, it's...

183
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,777
Honestly, it's hard.

184
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,237
Okay.

185
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,031
There's a lot of Ted in there.

186
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,951
Like, a lot of his stuff, and I just...

187
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,620
It's, like, I don't know.

188
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,872
It's kinda, like,
spiritually overwhelming.

189
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,665
Oh.

190
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,376
But it's okay.

191
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,590
Well, it doesn't... You're clearly
upset, so it doesn't seem okay.

192
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,925
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,428
No, no, please. I'm... I'm sorry.

194
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,887
No, I'm so sorry.

195
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,099
And honestly, there's, like,
a lot of valuable stuff in there.

196
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,393
So, I mean, maybe the kids want it or...

197
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,687
you could even sell some of it
and make some money.

198
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,398
I can't even bring
myself to go in there.

199
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,775
You think I'm ready
to start selling his stuff?

200
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,179
Oh, God, you're right. I'm sorry.

201
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:17,235
- I didn't...
- Oh, no.

202
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:19,288
I swear I didn't mean for you
to get rid of anything.

203
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,199
I can never get rid of anything.
I mean, I'm such a collector.

204
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,367
I totally am. I get it.

205
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,494
I even keep some of my stuff
in a storage facility.

206
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,540
- Okay. Just... one sec.
- Wait, you know what?

207
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,916
Forget I even said that.

208
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,587
Shit!

209
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,338
Ugh.

210
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,425
- Hi.
- Ma'am.

211
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,865
So, did you find the guy?
The license plate I called in?

212
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:43,763
That fucking aggro piece of shit?

213
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:45,848
- That's not...
- I don't know.

214
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,349
We're looking for Judy Hale.

215
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:51,549
Oh. Why are you looking for Judy?

216
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,151
- I'm Judy.
- Ma'am, we're here to inform you

217
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,779
that a temporary restraining order
has been placed on you,

218
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:02,281
barring you within 100 feet
of Steven Wood.

219
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,576
If we receive a complaint or notice

220
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,763
that you have violated the terms
of this order, you will be arrested.

221
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,537
Do you understand?

222
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,164
I understand.

223
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,707
Have a good day.

224
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,087
- I can see how this looks.
- So, what, are you...

225
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:18,792
Are you stalking him?

226
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,006
No.

227
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,049
Not really.

228
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:23,748
So, so, what is it?
Just, like, a light stalking?

229
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,920
I called him a bunch of times,
and he didn't answer,

230
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:27,473
so I showed up at his office.

231
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,517
- So you went to his office?
- And his house.

232
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,974
- And then the golf course.
- Judy...

233
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:36,273
I swear, this is more a reflection
of his character than it is of mine.

234
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,025
I have two kids
who've been through a lot.

235
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,736
I don't need cops showing up at my door.

236
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,988
I just wanted to talk to him
about selling the house,

237
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:46,242
But he'd rather call up his cop friends
and file a restraining order

238
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,007
to keep me from telling him
how hurt I am.

239
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,285
Hmm.

240
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,455
I'm just hurt.

241
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,872
Mm-hmm.

242
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,708
Bet you didn't know
she was a stalker, huh?

243
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:01,744
I did, actually, so...

244
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,678
Fuck.

245
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,486
- I told you that Steven was an asshole.
- I know.

246
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,725
Why'd you even wanna talk to that putz?

247
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,312
- There's a lot of things left unsaid.
- Let him go.

248
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,190
- Good riddance.
- I know. I can't.

249
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,025
Maybe I am crazy.

250
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:22,778
You are crazy. But who isn't?

251
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,655
You know what you oughta do?

252
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,408
You oughta fill out
one of these online profiles.

253
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,244
Or help me. I don't know what I'm doing.

254
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,078
All right.

255
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,621
Let's see.

256
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,294
Abe, you know,
you don't need to do online dating.

257
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,297
Half the women in here
are dying to get with you.

258
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,673
Let's see how you did.

259
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,800
Yup, you're alive.

260
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,636
Oh, you don't hear that
too often around here.

261
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,223
You know, if I saw you
in here, I'd click.

262
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,392
I'm not good enough for you.

263
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:56,979
Forty years ago, maybe, but...

264
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,148
I'm not so picky now.

265
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,692
- I'm serious.
- Hmm?

266
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:04,201
I've done some really bad things, Abe.

267
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,405
Aww, who among us?

268
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,532
We all mess up.

269
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,035
But I know you.

270
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,245
You're good.

271
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,539
Crazy or not.

272
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,958
- I love you.
- Aww.

273
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,759
Welcome to my humble abode.

274
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,062
Told you I'd make it up to you.

275
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,388
You did good.

276
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,182
Steve, can I be honest?

277
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,601
- No, lie to me.
- Hilarious.

278
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,144
This place is stunning, bro.

279
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,605
- Oh, thanks, man.
- No, it's perfect.

280
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,482
It... It'll sell so fast.

281
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,109
I mean, these interiors!
Are you sure you're not gay?

282
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:45,826
That I know of.

283
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,989
No, I'm sure. Water? Cold, room temp?

284
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,533
Oh, I'm so good.
Can I keep giving myself a tour?

285
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,285
Yeah, man. Knock yourself out, bro.

286
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,955
- Here we are.
- Oh, thanks.

287
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,040
- Figured you were a room temp girl.
- You got me.

288
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,875
- Perfect.
- It really is stunning.

289
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,168
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

290
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,672
It's weird, though. I would never
know Judy ever lived here.

291
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,922
Hm.

292
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,343
Yeah, I just always had a pretty clear
vision of the space, I guess.

293
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,546
She just let me run with it.

294
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,346
You know, I, um...

295
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,265
I don't wanna get
in the middle of anything, but...

296
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,393
a restraining order?

297
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,354
I mean, how concerned should I be?

298
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,398
Uh...

299
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,608
I'm sorry if that whole thing
caused any drama,

300
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,195
but, um, I felt like I needed
to send a message.

301
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,280
You know, she won't leave me alone.

302
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,740
Um...

303
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,326
I just wanna move on. That's all.

304
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,285
Right.

305
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,589
I'm gonna... Can I go upstairs?

306
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,333
- Mm. Mi casa is your casa. Please.
- Going up, too?

307
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,793
- Of course.
- Great.

308
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,130
Ooh! What's in here?

309
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,132
Oh, you know, actually...
Maybe you don't...

310
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,259
Okay. Well, this needs a little work.

311
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,428
Oh, I'm sorry about this.

312
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,678
Oh.

313
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,890
Uh, it's okay.

314
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,601
Well, you know, I honestly kind of...
forget about this room.

315
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,729
I usually just keep
the doors shut and...

316
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:05,774
- I can't really bring myself to...
- It's... I get it.

317
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,570
Judy told me about the miscarriages.

318
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,696
She did?

319
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,906
Yeah. She did.

320
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:15,409
It's terrible.

321
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,850
Can't tell you how many times
we started decorating this room.

322
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:19,996
I can imagine.

323
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,710
We waited too. You know this last
time we thought we were in the clear.

324
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,504
I mean, she was five months.

325
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,839
Um...

326
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,511
Should've waited longer.

327
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,724
You know, babies don't even need
their own room...

328
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:45,773
Look, I guess I don't know
either of you very well, but...

329
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,949
for what's it's worth, if I had gone

330
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:51,144
through what you and Judy went through,

331
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,280
I'd... be a little nuts too.

332
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Yeah.

333
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,139
I'm gonna show you the master suite.
It's sick.

334
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:03,081
Hm-hm. Okay.

335
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,398
Hey, Charlie. What's up?

336
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,945
What are you doing?

337
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,114
Oh!

338
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,616
Cool.

339
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,661
That game looks... so violent.

340
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,456
It's, like, disturbing, huh?

341
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,625
I don't talk to strangers.

342
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,418
Yeah, me neither.

343
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,170
Or stalkers.

344
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,839
No, that's smart.

345
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,050
But just so you know,
I'm not really a stalker.

346
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,511
I mean, not a good one, anyway.

347
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,721
Yeah. You got caught.

348
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,847
This time.

349
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,227
Honestly, the whole thing
is a misunderstanding.

350
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,648
And you expect me to believe that?

351
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,124
Well, you're playing a game where
the women have watermelon boobs,

352
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:17,239
but can somehow run 80 miles an hour
so, I don't know what you believe.

353
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,366
I believe you're annoying me.

354
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,869
I just wanted to say that, um...

355
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,331
I really appreciate you guys
letting me stay in your dad's studio.

356
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,170
Um, well, it wasn't my call.
My vote doesn't count.

357
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,172
It counts to me.

358
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,550
Whatever. It's...

359
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,305
It's just weird you being in there.

360
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,224
It's weird for me, too.

361
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,023
Do you have any weed?

362
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,690
Do you?

363
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,650
No.

364
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,277
Good.

365
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,866
Uh... You didn't answer.

366
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,369
I don't talk to strangers.

367
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,084
But I am gonna order a pizza
if you are at all interested.

368
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,589
Only if it has meat on it.

369
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,798
It shall.

370
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,933
How is it?

371
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,456
- Good.
- Good? Meaty?

372
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,770
Seriously, they killed a whole herd
of animals

373
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,688
for you to have that much meat
on your pizza.

374
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,941
- Okay.
- They taste pretty good.

375
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,619
- Want some of my meat?
- Sure.

376
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,787
There's meat on yours.
You can have all my meat.

377
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,947
Okay. I like it.

378
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,977
No wonder you couldn't sleep.

379
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,521
There's just so much shit in here.

380
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,327
Let's clear it all, okay?

381
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,079
- Really?
- Yeah.

382
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,871
You go ahead.

383
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,600
- Go ahead.
- No, go, please.

384
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:58,510
- You first.
- I'm not gonna fight you about this.

385
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,543
Okay.

386
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,887
Can I have Dad's Les Paul?

387
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,182
All right, kiddo. There you go.

388
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,058
- Thanks, Mom.
- Yeah.

389
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,644
Cool!

390
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,816
- I want the gun.
- Hmm?

391
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,567
- What gun?
- Dad's gun.

392
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,362
Okay. Well, it is in the safe,
and I do not have the combination.

393
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,100
And even if I did have the combination,

394
00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:28,648
I would be getting rid of the gun.

395
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,617
Why do you want Daddy's gun?

396
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,204
For protection, you know?
I'm the man of the house now.

397
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,747
Oh, come on, please.

398
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,187
I don't know where you're getting
this patriarchal shit from,

399
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,836
but you are not the man of the house,
you are a child.

400
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,797
I am the woman of the house
and I do the protecting.

401
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,297
So...

402
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,008
You can have the drums.

403
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,092
Yes!

404
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,851
- Did I just get played?
- I'm pretty sure you did.

405
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,895
Wait. I'm sorry. There's a gun in here?

406
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,271
Mm-hmm.

407
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,814
Sorry.

408
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:06,682
Shit, this is heavy.

409
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,157
It's so heavy!

410
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,409
Why didn't we hire guys
to do this for us?

411
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,287
Because we're empowered women.

412
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,570
And I might have told you
it would be cathartic for you.

413
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,249
Yeah. Well, it's not.

414
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,416
Well, now we know.

415
00:24:20,473 --> 00:24:21,690
And, you know, hiring men to do our

416
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:23,725
bidding is also very empowering, so...

417
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,298
Yes. Uh, note taken.

418
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,261
I appreciate you making room for me.

419
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,805
Yeah. I appreciate you telling me
about the storage place.

420
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,603
You know, I saw the nursery
at Steve's house the other day.

421
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,169
Your house.

422
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,356
- Really?
- Yeah.

423
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,943
He, uh... He couldn't bear
to go in there either.

424
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,037
He couldn't even look
when I opened the door.

425
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,949
Well, I told you Steve's not really good
at dealing with feelings.

426
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,035
I mean, I honestly can't blame him.

427
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:56,345
You know?

428
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,873
Grief does some weird shit to people.

429
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:00,956
You know?

430
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,337
What you guys went through was...
was intense.

431
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,546
Yeah.

432
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,300
It was.

433
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:18,814
Holy shit.

434
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,291
Are you all right?

435
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,168
Oh, yeah.

436
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,044
Mm-hmm.

437
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,131
Hey, you know what?

438
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,759
This is for you.

439
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,316
I just thought you might want it back.

440
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,851
Oh, my God!

441
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,604
Thank you.

442
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,732
Wow.

443
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,402
- Did you steal it?
- No.

444
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,362
No, Steve said I could have it.

445
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,864
I mean, I would've stolen it
if I had to, you know.

446
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,992
That's so sweet.

447
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,578
You know,

448
00:26:21,255 --> 00:26:24,624
there was something that Steve
said that really, really bothered me.

449
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,335
What?

450
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,130
He said you were nuts.

451
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,547
Oh, yeah.

452
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,844
It was practically my nickname.

453
00:26:33,878 --> 00:26:35,552
No, but that's not okay.

454
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,888
Men call women nuts and crazy
way too often

455
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,390
just to undermine us.

456
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,771
- You know?
- Yeah. You're right.

457
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,404
No, I mean you shouldn't be
able to call someone crazy anymore.

458
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:47,192
- No, you shouldn't.
- No, crazy...

459
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:49,399
should go the way of the R-word.

460
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,900
R-word?

461
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,485
Don't make me say it.

462
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,112
- Retard...
- Got it, got it.

463
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,743
Oh, you motherfucker!

464
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,245
What? What? What's wrong?

465
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,787
Wait here.

466
00:27:08,057 --> 00:27:09,392
What are you doing?

467
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,003
Jen?

468
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,726
Hey!

469
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Hey!

470
00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:30,865
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

471
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,941
Get in the car!

472
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,821
Hey!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
