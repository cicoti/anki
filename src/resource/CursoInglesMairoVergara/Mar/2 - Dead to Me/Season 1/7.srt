1
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:24,858
You're welcome.

2
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,736
Good morning to you. Why am I welcome?
What am I looking at?

3
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:31,156
That is a piece of the car
that killed Ted.

4
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:34,200
Hard evidence that I procured.

5
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,911
Now, you can have it
and run it through the scanner.

6
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,080
- What scanner?
- I told her there was no scanner.

7
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,252
Hey. Good to see you again.

8
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:47,671
Uh-huh. I'll move past the fact
that you brought in your own cop

9
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,007
and ask where that came from?

10
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,801
This is from Shandy Addams,
the girl that found Ted.

11
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,845
And you went to her?

12
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,653
No, she came to me.
Why does that matter?

13
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,141
It matters because there is
a process for these things.

14
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,267
A process?

15
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,854
The process that has given you
no leads or suspects?

16
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,623
You guys have been at this for months
and you have found nothing.

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,734
I'm at it for one day, I find this.

18
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,195
Now I wonder what else is out there.

19
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,614
I wanna see everything you have.
All of it.

20
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,158
- I wanna see the whole file.
- No, I can't do that.

21
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,243
Yeah, I know you can do it
because I Googled it.

22
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,584
You're allowed to see it, but there is

23
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:22,115
a reason that we don't show evidence

24
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,251
- to the loved ones of the deceased.
- I want to see it.

25
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,129
It is disturbing
and it might be hard to handle.

26
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,923
You don't know what I can handle.

27
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,637
Yup.

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,723
Good job. Pound it out.

29
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,891
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:46,663 --> 00:01:49,791
Out of curiosity, are there any
toll roads that branch from the scene?

31
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,822
There's the one in PCH
and the ones that lead to Yorba Linda.

32
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,281
CCTV from those?

33
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:58,708
Lots, but without a license
or a make of the vehicle, we...

34
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,747
You know, in Santa Ana,
we had a case like this.

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,341
Uh... Mrs. Harding?

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
What?

37
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,679
Are you okay?

38
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,848
I'm fine.

How can I help you?

41
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,957
[SPEAKING IN GREEK]

42
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,712
Girl, you can't just go in there.

43
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,172
- Girl!
- Where is it?

44
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,340
- Judy.
- Steve.

45
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,216
Hi.

46
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,301
Hi.

47
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,552
Sorry to interrupt.

48
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,014
Uh...

49
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,893
Yeah.

50
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,604
Bye, guys. God, it's a great suit.
I love your pocket square.

51
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,064
All right. Bye. Thank you.

52
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:12,890
- Why are you here?
- She's got a piece of the car!

53
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:15,432
- What are you talking about? Where?
- Jen, she has a piece of our car.

54
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:16,490
She's putting it through...

55
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:17,542
- the scanner right now.
- Easy.

56
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:19,224
Which will lead to us and then
she's gonna find out that it was me,

57
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:20,521
so I need to know where the car is!

58
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:21,645
- Right now!
- Hey. Hey.

59
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,745
Will you calm down, okay?
I'm taking care of it.

60
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,548
- Okay.
- The car is not gonna be a problem.

61
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,705
Why? Where is it?

62
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,166
It's someplace safe.

63
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,083
Is it at your mother's?

64
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,462
- It's at my mother's.
- Oh, great.

65
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,848
Womderful. I can't wait to get
wrapped up in all this with Eileen.

66
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,467
She's at the lake house.
You don't have to worry.

67
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,388
She's been going through
a lot lately, so lay off.

68
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:42,055
- With what? Her leather allergy?
- Yes, actually.

69
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,305
That's not a real thing.

70
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,748
Oh, that's not a thing. But somehow
you're ruled by the moon?

71
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,280
- Go back to your Greeks.
- Judy. Where are you going?

72
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,953
- Don't go to my mom's house.
- I'm going.

73
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
Judy!

74
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,568
Bye, girl.

75
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:57,287
Judy!

76
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,906
Hi! It's Judy. Leave me a message.
Thanks.

77
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,116
Judy, hi. Um...

78
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,035
It's me. Uh...

79
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,912
Sorry. I just, um...

80
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:08,603
I really need to talk to you.

81
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,585
I think you're the only person
who would understand. I'm...

82
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,171
I'm at the station and...

83
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,922
I saw...

84
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,348
I saw pictures of Ted after the accident

85
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:22,503
and I thought I could
handle it and I'm...

86
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,557
I don't think I'm handling it now.
Please, can you just call me back?

87
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,185
I guess I just... I need you.

88
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
It's gross.

89
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,231
Sorry. Um...

90
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,441
Okay. Bye.

91
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:50,998
Wow.

92
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,554
Told you the car
wasn't gonna be a problem.

93
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,422
This is not what I expected.

94
00:04:57,677 --> 00:05:00,100
Yeah, well, I'm sitting there thinking,
"How do I get rid of this thing?"

95
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,831
You know. It's always
gonna be somewhere.

96
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,386
What if it's everywhere?

97
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,681
Right? You dismantle it, you break
it down to the component parts,

98
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,817
you dump them
in three different junkyards in Mexico,

99
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,268
and, poof, the car is gone.

100
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,603
- No car, no crime.
- Exactly.

101
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,930
No matter what they find out,
they don't have evidence,

102
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,608
or an eyewitness tying us to the scene,
they have nothing.

103
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,485
Ted was the only witness.

104
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,071
Yeah. And Ted's dead. So we are good.

105
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,337
- Where did you even learn to do this?
- Online. Watched a few videos.

106
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,590
I pick up things up pretty quick, girl,
you know that.

107
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,384
It turns out certain things come apart
a lot easier than you'd expect.

108
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,627
Yeah.

109
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,631
- Happy birthday, baby.
- What?

110
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,842
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

111
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,851
God, it's Jen. She keeps calling me.

112
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,478
Pick it up. Tell her I said hi.

113
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,021
- No.
- Why?

114
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:56,616
What if she knows? What if they already
put the piece through the scanner?

115
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:58,809
What if they already
put the piece through the scanner?

116
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,443
The scanner doesn't scare me.

117
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,695
I'm sorry. Would you calm down?

118
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,865
First of all, my dad is buddies
with the sheriff, okay? They golf.

119
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,034
And, B, I grew up with
those Laguna cops.

120
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,079
They are beach town cops. The only thing
they're gonna catch is a wave.

121
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,289
They have technology.

122
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:17,494
Gee, if they can trace these parts
to a junkyard in Rosarito

123
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,046
with one little piece of a car,
then hats off to them.

124
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,964
- I will turn myself in.
- Stop it.

125
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,967
I'm taking care of it, okay?

126
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,362
I'm seeing everything from the outside

127
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:28,187
and I'm ten moves ahead, I promise you.

128
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,621
I won't let anything happen to you.

129
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,517
Okay. Thank you.
But we really need to do it today.

130
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,772
We don't know how fast
things will start moving.

131
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,683
I got meetings back-to-back all day.

132
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,148
My morning's already ruined.

133
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,151
Fine! Go to your meetings
and I'll just finish everything.

134
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,235
Just show me how to use the tools.
I'll keep going.

135
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,572
- Really, Ponyboy?
- Yes.

136
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,658
I can't think of this
as half-finished anymore.

137
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,536
I just really, really need this
nightmare to be over.

138
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,708
Okay.

139
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,005
I will cancel my meetings
and we'll take care of this today.

140
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,341
Thank you.

141
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,551
There you go.

142
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,433
I'm seeing someone.

143
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,103
That's great. I'm super happy for you.

144
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,192
Oh! Look at this wainscoting.

145
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,735
- It's wonderful.
- Mmm.

146
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,322
I'm in a cottage and I am loving life.

147
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,188
Mmm. Honey, you could do
your scrapbooking in that corner.

148
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:32,318
Oh, love!

149
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:35,399
And the light
in this area too. It's just to die for.

150
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:36,956
- Right, Jen?
- Yup.

151
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,756
I mean, in the morning, the sun just

152
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,826
drapes across this floor and you feel,

153
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,503
I don't know, forgiven.

154
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,382
Ooh, this kitchen! Beautiful.

155
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,718
I'm not crazy about
those sliding glass doors.

156
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,437
I hear you. But a look at that deck!

157
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,230
I mean, let me show you
where the grill goes.

158
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,892
Now, let's talk modern cabinetry.

159
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,936
I used to be into a more rustic look,

160
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,523
you know, farm style this and that,
the barn door, the porcelain knobs.

161
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,172
But, lo and behold,

162
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:06,369
now, and if you knew me,
you would not see this coming...

163
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,946
Now I like sleek. I like simple.

164
00:08:09,662 --> 00:08:13,583
So that's why I'm gravitating
to these more modern fixtures.

165
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,204
This is a bamboo fusion, isn't it?

166
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,830
I don't know, actually.

167
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,292
Wouldn't you say? I think it's a bamboo
fusion or is it anutmeg finish?

168
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:22,782
A nutmeg finish or a bamboo fusion?

169
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,296
I saw this on a magazine.
It definitely said, "Bamboo fusion."

170
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,798
I even clipped it out
and saved it for a moment like this.

171
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,562
I'm always losing things,
aren't I, honey?

172
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,135
Ha, don't get me started.

173
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,387
I even got a filing system and I spilled

174
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:36,382
Earl Grey all over it and tea stains.

175
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,725
- It does.
- It does.

176
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,268
- I know.
- Isn't that sad?

177
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,771
- Oh, it's so sad.
- No, this is not sad.

178
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,733
- Oh, honey, are you okay?
- No. Please excuse me for a second.

179
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,028
Are you okay?

180
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:53,241
Oh, my God! Do I fucking look okay,
you vapid fucking twat?

181
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,754
- That crazy massage?
- That was Sedona.

182
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,215
It wasn't Sedona. It was Santa Fe.

183
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,221
Maybe you went to Sedona
with your new boyfriend.

184
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:16,847
No. You and I... went to Sedona.
Remember?

185
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,934
Remember that room with the fireplace
and fountain and you were all,

186
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:23,779
"I don't care about vortexes,"
and you became the Vortex Guy.

187
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,063
Okay. I...

188
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,733
I let you talk about it
for, like, two seconds.

189
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,860
- That doesn't make me the Vortex Guy.
- Oh, yeah.

190
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,446
I liked the hike we went on, though.

191
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,199
Even though I burned my dick.

192
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,367
Oh, my God.

193
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,661
I almost forgot about that.

194
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,463
Yeah. That's a "hashtag
never forget" for me.

195
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,656
Well, that's what you get for
not wearing any underwear

196
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:43,883
with floppy shorts

197
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,167
and falling asleep in the sun.

198
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,962
You made me not wear underwear
for sperm count, remember?

199
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,405
There's something else
I want to ask about that trip.

200
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:54,504
What?

201
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:56,618
Do you remember when we went to
the Petrified Forest?

202
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,663
- Yeah.
- Okay.

203
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:01,581
Okay. Do you remember the sign that
said if you take any of these rocks,

204
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,769
you're gonna have bad luck
for the rest of your life?

205
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,188
Yeah, I kind of remember that.

206
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,402
Okay. Well, I never told you,
but I heard a radio show about that.

207
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,924
About how these people
who had taken rocks

208
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,231
sent them back years later with letters

209
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:21,412
saying that, "My life has fallen apart,"
or, "My wife left me,"

210
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,913
or, "I lost my job."

211
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,375
And they all attribute it
to stealing a rock from that place.

212
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,797
Did you steal one of those rocks?

213
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,092
Oh, come on! That's such bullshit.
Really?

214
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,637
It's just people blaming
their crappy lives on something else.

215
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,080
Perspective, Judy. It's important.

216
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,807
- Perspective and mindset.
- Okay. Fine.

217
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,309
But did you take one?

218
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,400
I mean, I remember wanting to.
But, no, I didn't take one.

219
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,612
- You promise?
- Yeah.

220
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,545
Here's that healer's info.

221
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,163
She does a thing
where you hold a baby chick.

222
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,541
You just hold a chick. It will help.

223
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,711
Thank you so much.
I'm really sorry again.

224
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,338
Okay.

225
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,217
Before you say anything,
I need you to know...

226
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,510
This isn't working.

227
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,845
It wasn't... it wasn't that bad.

228
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,722
It was very that bad.

229
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,367
Let's just say an atmosphere of polish

230
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,234
and professionalism was not achieved.

231
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,477
Okay. You know what?

232
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,980
I promise you it will
never happen again.

233
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,400
It won't. Because I can't anymore.

234
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,911
You can't what?

235
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,908
This. All of this.

236
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:37,688
What is this? What are you pointing at?

237
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,281
Jesus, help me find my strength.

238
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:41,192
We can't pretend this is the first time

239
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:42,950
you've shit the bed on a sale, honey.

240
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,456
You keep driving clients away.
You scare people. You scare me.

241
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,251
So what is happening here right now?
Are you breaking up with me?

242
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,460
Just professionally.

243
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,214
And I didn't want to,
but you've made it impossible.

244
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,133
Okay. Hm...

245
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,213
I know that I haven't been at the top
of my game the last few months,

246
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,598
but I don't know if you've heard,
my husband was murdered.

247
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,976
So, yeah, I haven't
really been in the best place.

248
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,854
Look, I pray for you
and your boys every day.

249
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,981
I have tried to be a good friend to you.

250
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,109
But it's not like your issues
started the day Ted died.

251
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,946
I've been thinking about having
this conversation with you for years.

252
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,117
Ever since the Shorewood condos,
when you ripped apart that ficus.

253
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,079
Oh, my God. You were with me on that.
We both hated that ficus.

254
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,414
It did not belong there.

255
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,032
What about Crystal Cove, when you yelled

256
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:32,326
at that sweet couple, the Walshes?

257
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,462
What? It wasn't...

258
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,046
She was racist.

259
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,423
She was 80.

260
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,093
Jen, your anger is untenable.

261
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,054
And I don't know how
to help you with it.

262
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,891
I just know I can't do this anymore.

263
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,998
Hi. Excuse me. Do you know
where I could find Judy Hale?

265
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,209
Never heard of her.

266
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,084
Okay.

267
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:19,048
Are you a friend of Judy's?

268
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,424
Yeah.

269
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,092
Hi.

270
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:24,833
I'm Jen.

271
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:28,015
Oh, you're the nice lady
that she stays with?

272
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,559
And you must be Abe.

273
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,102
My whole life.

274
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,605
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

275
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,173
Uh, Judy, uh...

276
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,445
- called in sick.
- Really?

277
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,073
I don't think she's sick.

278
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,326
Well, she's probably
with that asshole, Steve.

279
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,660
Hmm.

280
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,579
I think you might be right.

281
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,835
You okay, sweetheart?

282
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,421
Yeah. I...

283
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,466
just had a really shitty day.

284
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,803
Actually, a few shitty years.

285
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,222
Oh. I'm sorry.

286
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,224
It's okay.

287
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,352
'Cause I think maybe I deserve it.

288
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,108
I wouldn't be too sure of that.
I don't believe in deserves.

289
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,112
You think the child at Auschwitz
got what he deserved?

290
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,114
Oh, God. Of course not.

291
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:29,034
No, I just...
I just think I deserve this day.

292
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,791
Don't be so hard on yourself.

293
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,962
Thanks, Abe.

294
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,340
I can see why Judy loves you so much.

295
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,383
Me too.

296
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,681
Look at us.

297
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,184
Sharing a little Cuervo Tradicional.

298
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,272
Oh, is it tradicional?

299
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,567
That's how you're supposed to say it.

300
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,861
You don't have to roll the R
a bit or anything?

301
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,782
Man, I can't wait to
get rid of that thing.

302
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,187
I wish I'd never bought you that.

303
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,703
You didn't know.

304
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:19,251
The truth is, I wish I'd done
a lot of things differently...

305
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,628
with us.

306
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,423
Yeah. Me too.

307
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,177
We were good together.

308
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:30,325
- Mmm.
- I know we had some hard times, but...

309
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:33,215
yeah, there were some great times too.

310
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,936
And I really hope that...

311
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,521
this new guy...

312
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,192
knows how to take care of you.

313
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,611
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

314
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,490
The whole "I hope this new guy
can take care of you the way I did."

315
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,410
And that thing that you're doing
right now with your eyes.

316
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,246
What? I can't use my eyes?

317
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,375
The way that you're
looking at me, just stop.

318
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,960
I'm looking at you like a person.

319
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,170
I do not think you look
at your grandmother like that.

320
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,882
You have no idea how I look
at my grandmother. My grandmother...

321
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,260
was a very handsome woman.

322
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,474
She was.

323
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,981
- What?
- It's that.

324
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,519
- That thing.
- Don't know what you're talking about.

325
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:26,554
- It's not a thing.
- It is a thing.

326
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:29,093
There's no thing. You're making it
a thing by calling it a thing.

327
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:31,016
I am definitely not making it a thing.

328
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,740
It is already a thing that exists

329
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,869
and I'm pointing it out. And you
don't need a microscope to see it.

330
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,289
- Oh, so I'm in science class now?
- Oh, yeah.

331
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:40,916
You are.

332
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,585
- Shut up.
- What?

333
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,965
I know you know what you're doing.

334
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,676
How about we do a little test?

335
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,429
- I'm gonna close my eyes.
- Okay.

336
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,098
- When I open them...
- Mm-hm.

337
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,933
You tell me if there's a thing.

338
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,062
- Are you ready?
- Fine. Sure.

339
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,518
Judy?

340
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:42,859
Oh.

341
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,005
- Hi.
- Hey.

342
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,269
Uh... Thought I'd stop by,
see if you're doing okay.

343
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,318
And I came across this piece of pie.

344
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:51,153
That's very sweet of you.

345
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,237
Come on in.

346
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,117
Can I get you a glass of wine
or a beer or something?

347
00:17:57,254 --> 00:17:59,614
- Beer. Beer would be great.
- Beer it is. All right.

348
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,171
- There you go.
- Thanks. Yeah.

349
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,341
How you holding up? I know this
morning was a lot to take in.

350
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:13,966
Yeah.

351
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,303
How was the rest of your day?

352
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,305
Incredibly shitty.

353
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,349
Worst one yet.

354
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,491
Of course not as bad
as the day my husband

355
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:24,028
went for a run and never came back.

356
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,146
Because that was a...
that was a real bummer.

357
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,522
Right.

358
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,069
Anyway, that's very nice of you
to check up on me.

359
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,823
I'm sure none of the reason
you're here is to see Judy.

360
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,593
Oh! Nope. God, no.

361
00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:39,156
No, I'm really...

362
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:41,201
- I'm trying to avoid her, you know.
- Right. Right.

363
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:42,838
- By showing up to where she lives?
- Yeah.

364
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,332
Exactly. And ponder what kind
of baked goods she might like.

365
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,459
Mmm. It's carrot cake, by the way.

366
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,296
- Carrot cake.
- And, uh... she's not here.

367
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,715
- He went out for a run?
- Hmm?

368
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,843
Ted. You said
he went for a run that night?

369
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,968
Yeah.

370
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,263
I saw in the file he was wearing Vans.

371
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,935
Yeah. Yeah, he was wearing Vans.

372
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,646
He didn't like running shoes.

373
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,857
Didn't even own any.

374
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,193
Something about toughening up
the bottom of his feet.

375
00:19:13,868 --> 00:19:14,938
Yeah.

376
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,237
Yeah.

377
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,872
This IPA is good.

378
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,700
It's, like, hoppy. It's really hoppy.

379
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:20,801
Oh, you know what?

380
00:19:20,864 --> 00:19:23,985
I'm so sorry, I really...
I should take myself to bed. I'm just...

381
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:26,339
- A big day tomorrow.
- Oh. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

382
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,041
Figuring out my life.

383
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,003
- Yeah, got it.
- I'll tell Judy you stopped by,

384
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,337
- not to see her.
- Mm-hm.

385
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,756
- Not to see her.
- No. Of course not.

386
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,341
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Bye, Nick.

387
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,509
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

388
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,969
- Good night.
- Good night.

389
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,103
Okay.

390
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,232
I really did love that car.

391
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,858
I know you did.

392
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,573
- All right.
- Careful.

393
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,410
Oh! Uh...

394
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:09,374
I gotta be honest with you. Um...

395
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,001
I...

396
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,211
I did.

397
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,172
You did what?

398
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,215
Uh...

399
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,010
Take one of the rocks
from the Petrified Forest.

400
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,095
Didn't you?

401
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,349
- No.
- Come on.

402
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,393
No, I did not, Steve.

403
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,228
Why not?

404
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,232
What do you mean, why not?
Because those are sacred rocks.

405
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,692
Because they asked you not to take them.

406
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,528
Because there is a sign there that says,
"This is bad luck."

407
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,906
Oh, please. My life is ruined
because I stole a rock?

408
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,033
But not because I'm a jack-off?

409
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,160
Come on. I promise you,
it doesn't matter.

410
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,787
Everything is gonna be fine.

411
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,705
Okay?

412
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,457
I'll call you later.

413
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,949
Hey.

414
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,202
- What the fuck?
- Hi.

415
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,579
Look, I don't even know what to say.

416
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,333
- Jen...
- No. It is so fucked up.

417
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,876
Jen, I'm so sorry.

418
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,421
You were with Steve, weren't you?

419
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,549
I... I was.

420
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,345
You know what? You could at least
have texted me back. Jesus, Judy.

421
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,515
The last time someone that I loved
didn't call me back, he was dead.

422
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,017
Oh, my God.

423
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,476
You're right.

424
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,982
- I'm so sorry. I'm such an asshole.
- I needed you today.

425
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,359
Like, really needed you.

426
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,404
And that's very hard for me to admit.

427
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,741
I'm sorry.

428
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,912
I mean, how did it go
with the police this morning?

429
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,741
I don't wanna fucking talk about it.
I'm going to bed.

430
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,458
Okay?

431
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,376
Steve?

432
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,003
Seriously?

433
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,840
What does that guy have over you, Judy?

434
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,930
- I wish I could say.
- Hmm.

435
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,556
Good night.

436
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,900
Okay. Yeah.

437
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,236
Thank you. Thank you so much.

438
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,736
Bye.

439
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,947
It's a new day, Judy.

440
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,324
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

441
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,994
They found the make and model
of the car that killed Ted.

442
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,077
- What?
- Uh-huh!

443
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,534
And that was Nick and he's gonna get me

444
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,160
a list of every registered owner

445
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,825
of that kind of car in Orange County.

446
00:24:19,895 --> 00:24:22,961
- Oh, wow!
- I know. Oh, my God.

447
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,882
It's a 1966 Mustang. Isn't that weird?

448
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,093
It's just so weird to know that now.

449
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,221
- It's creepy, right?
- Kinda.

450
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,641
But it's, like, yeah, this happened.

451
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,686
This happened
and this is the person that did it

452
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,938
and this is the car that they drove.

453
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,224
- It's... it's amazing, right?
- God.

454
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,152
- It's super amazing.
- Yeah.

455
00:24:48,872 --> 00:24:49,894
I mean but...

456
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:51,727
- here's where my mind goes right now.
- What?

457
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,377
If you were the person that hit them,

458
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:55,235
wouldn't you maybe have
gotten rid of the car?

459
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,497
I mean, wouldn't that be, like,
the first thing you would do?

460
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,290
Maybe.

461
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,167
But... maybe not.

462
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:06,630
If you really think about it,
that would look really suspicious.

463
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,298
- Don't you think?
- No.

464
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,862
I mean, if it was me,
I wouldn't get rid of the car

465
00:25:10,904 --> 00:25:12,397
because of how guilty
it would make me look.

466
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:16,389
It's kind of, like, the worst thing
you could possibly do.

467
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,850
Like putting a fucking bulls-eye
on your head.

468
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,153
But, yeah, it doesn't matter.

469
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,606
Even if the person got rid of the car,
we'll still know they had it.

470
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,733
- Right.
- Mm-hm.

471
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,361
All right. I'm gonna shower.

472
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,071
It's a new day, Judy.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
