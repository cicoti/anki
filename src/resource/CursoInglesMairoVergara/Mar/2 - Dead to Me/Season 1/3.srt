1
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,723
Mom!

2
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:16,850
Mom! Dad's here!

3
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:18,741
Huh?

4
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,604
- Wait. What did you just say?
- Dad came to visit me again.

5
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,274
Okay. Honey, I'm not
really following you.

6
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,735
I see a little bird.

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,286
You know how Dad used to come in
and wake me up for school,

8
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,612
when he was...

9
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,199
- You know.
- Mm-hm.

10
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:36,327
Now the bird started coming to my window
every morning. Just like Dad.

11
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,204
Oh, Boop.

12
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,999
Hey. Breakfast is almost ready.
It's a frittata.

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:46,046
Henry thinks that the bird
is his dead father.

14
00:00:47,344 --> 00:00:48,840
That's where we're at right now.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,135
Oh, maybe it is him.

16
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,220
I know you're into some woo-woo stuff,

17
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,181
but you don't really think that
that's his dad?

18
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,642
I don't know. I mean, I do believe
the spirits of our loved ones

19
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,770
can find a way to come back to us.

20
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,106
- Okay.
- Look at him.

21
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,859
Come on, what's the harm? He's so happy.

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,819
I guess.

23
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:22,869

24
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,294
Before we get started, I wanna say

25
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,506
I am happy to see Jen
and Judy here together.

26
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,590
What a nice surprise.

27
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:31,993
- Thank you.
- Surprise!

28
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:33,942
Last time, you was really pissed at her.

29
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:37,263
I was actually scared for you.

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,599
All right, you know what, guys?
I have an idea.

31
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:40,934
Let's talk about death.

32
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,226
Yes, please.

33
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,715
And remember our rule, everyone.

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,605
You only have to share
what you wanna share.

35
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,901
I would like to share
that I'm really grateful to Jen

36
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,779
for her friendship and for so much more.

37
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,029
So...

38
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:56,072
That's wonderful. It just goes to show

39
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:59,452
that through all of this pain and
tragedy, good things can happen.

40
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,664
- Anyone else?
- I'll go.

41
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:08,753
My son has started talking to a bird
that he thinks is his dead dad.

42
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,631
Which, I understand, is not crazy.

43
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,006
So, thank you.

44
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,509
I think it's sweet.

45
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,761
And who knows? Right?

46
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,889
Come on. I mean, I think I know, but...

47
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,976
it is... it is sweet.

48
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:24,777
You know, I mean, I...

49
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,773
I want him to, you know,
think what he needs to think

50
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:32,902
to feel better, but it just doesn't
make me feel any better.

51
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,347
I'm ready to not be
reminded of Ted every day,

52
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,740
and everywhere I look,
and every conversation that I have...

53
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,036
Like really, really tired
of talking about it.

54
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,121
You brought it up.

55
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,709
Jen, I know
it feels relentless now, but...

56
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,295
maybe those reminders
are there for a reason.

57
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,172
So we're forced to face our grief.

58
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,257
Oh... I'm facing it.

59
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,635
It's his birthday tomorrow.

60
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,095
It is?

61
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,388
Fiftieth.

62
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,936
Jen... I think you should celebrate
Ted's birthday.

63
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,438
Oh, I don't.

64
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,483
I'm not gonna sing
happy birthday to a dead man.

65
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,027
That's weird.

66
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,905
Maybe you wanna do something
to memorialize Ted.

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,324
On the first birthday
after my aunt died,

68
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,056
my family wrote messages
to my aunt of all

69
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,986
the things they never
got a chance to say.

70
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,207
And they put these messages
inside balloons, and then...

71
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,029
we released them to heaven.

72
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:31,502
- Absolutely not.
- I love that.

73
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,505
Look around, enjoy.

74
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,843
Hi. You see the couple over there
with matching sweaters?

75
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,679
Oh, yeah. Mr. and Mrs. Talbots.

76
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,432
Verbal offer, 50 over asking.
She loves it.

77
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,143
And he cheated on her,
so his opinion doesn't matter.

78
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,020
Ooh!

79
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,314
Is that Jen the Closer I see?

80
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,274
- I missed her.
- Me too.

81
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,526
- It's nice to focus on something else.
- Right.

82
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,991
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, God.

83
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,660
The Queen has arrived.

84
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,246
Fan out, team.
I want our own pictures of everything.

85
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,705
Angelica, closets.

86
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,495
- Not it. No...
- So, you'll be talking to her...

87
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:13,112
- I said "not it." You didn't hear me.
- I don't think you said that.

88
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:14,265
Yeah, I said "not it" first.

89
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,748
You can talk to her in a way
that no one else can.

90
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,301
When I'm talking to her, I'm imagining
stabbing her in the fucking throat.

91
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,825
- Enjoy. She's right behind you.
- I said "not..." I hate you.

92
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,266
Hi, Lorna.

93
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,435
Hi. Was that Christopher?
He's paler than I remember.

94
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,814
- Yeah.
- So, this is a decent listing for you.

95
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,023
- Good neighborhood.
- Yeah.

96
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,027
Though I hear the schools are slipping.

97
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,819
Really? I hadn't heard that.

98
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:42,073
Well, you know me. Eyes and ears
everywhere, my little spies.

99
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,368
- Is the seller motivated?
- Yes, he is.

100
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:47,745
I think we're gonna have
a competitive situation.

101
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,539
Blowing up on Zillow...

102
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,958
Well, you priced it too low.

103
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,294
Are we done?

104
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,216
We should probably talk about
Ted's birthday tomorrow.

105
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,136
Must be hard on you. I'm a wreck.

106
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,095
Actually, I'm okay.

107
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,434
You've always been able
to compartmentalize. I envy that.

108
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,520
The floors are nice.
But of course I can't.

109
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,480
Ted was my only son.

110
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,982
Ted was my only husband.

111
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,650
Oh, I know.

112
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,485
But you can always remarry.

113
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,488
I'm his mother. I can't replace him.

114
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,660
You know what? You should really
look at the master bathroom.

115
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,370
It is beautifully appointed.

116
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,164
His and hers sinks?

117
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,124
You better fucking believe it.

118
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,374
Hmm.

119
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,169
Oh...

120
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,755
- One more thing.
- Yup?

121
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,008
I'm planning a small event
for Ted's birthday at my house.

122
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,801
- No.
- Nothing elaborate.

123
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,894
Just friends, work
friends, acquaintances.

124
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,013
I said no.

125
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,058
- What do you mean, "no"?
- Because it...

126
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,518
Because...

127
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:58,316
I'm planning an event for Ted's birthday
at my house with the boys.

128
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,610
What kind of event?

129
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,362
A memorial.

130
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,032
We're gonna, like...

131
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,621
gonna write little messages
on pieces of paper, and then...

132
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,416
put them into balloons, and, you know...

133
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,045
float 'em up to the heavens.

134
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,505
That's what we're doing.

135
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,308
- I'll be there.
- Don't go out of your way.

136
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,842
- See you then.
- Fuck!

137
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,137
Wow!

138
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,807
Hey, this looks great.

139
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,977
Agatha, I really have to compliment
your sense of perspective.

140
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,813
I'm very good, right?

141
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,314
- Yeah.
- Where is it?

142
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,398
You too.

143
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,732
Where is it?

144
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,195
You gotta be kidding me.

145
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:45,856
There's a piece missing!

146
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,971
- What?
- Yeah.

147
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,842
Here. I'll help you find it.
Don't get your blood pressure up.

148
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,461
Do you know how disappointing it is
to work on a puzzle for a week

149
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,080
and you end up
and the last piece is missing!

150
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,416
I mean, this is gonna
stay with me for months.

151
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,418
God Almighty!

152
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,169
- Huh?
- I found it.

153
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,880
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

154
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,383
- Yeah.
- Hi, Judy.

155
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,222
Hi.

156
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,725
Uh, I wanna talk.

157
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,977
Hello, Abe.

158
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,312
Hello, Steve.

159
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,814
You asshole.

160
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,273
Uh...

161
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,901
Yeah, okay.

162
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:26,821
I thought I couldn't get

163
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,866
- within 100 yards of you?
- Judy, Judy... I spoke to Jen.

164
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,826
Super cool chick, by the way.

165
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,410
Uh...

166
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,582
She said something that...
I don't know, it kind of...

167
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,666
hit me.

168
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,258
And it made me think I went
a little overboard about

169
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,621
the restraining order.

170
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:48,217
So, sorry, and I wanted to
let you know that I had it revoked.

171
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,513
She's his wife.

172
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,889
Whose wife?

173
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,350
The guy we hit.

174
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,270
We hit a deer.

175
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,231
- Well, the deer had a wife.
- Okay.

176
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,747
And I befriended her,
and I've been trying

177
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,578
to tell you, but you
keep shutting me out.

178
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,905
Why would you...
What the fuck are you thinking?

179
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,115
- We ruined her life!
- Oh, Jesus, no.

180
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,993
I made friends with her. We're friends.
And I'm helping her.

181
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,495
It's the least I can do. Maybe...

182
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,122
Maybe there could be something good
that comes out of this.

183
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,124
Oh, my God.

184
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,875
You are nuts.

185
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,003
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

186
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,086
It's okay.

187
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,841
Judy, you murdered her husband!

188
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:32,617
You said it was manslaughter.
And it was an accident.

189
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,182
And you were there too.

190
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,501
So you thought it'd be a great idea

191
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,023
to invite her into both of our lives?

192
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,282
She's selling my fucking house!

193
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:40,688
Which I have a lot of feelings about
because that's our house.

194
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,189
- We are so far past that right now!
- Don't yell at me.

195
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,398
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

196
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,984
Look, we had a plan. Right?

197
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,946
We were gonna lock this away
and not bring it up again.

198
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,698
No. You had a plan.
I wanted to tell the truth.

199
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,783
Judy!

200
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,910
Is everything all right out there?

201
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,829
Yeah, Abe, I'm fine, thanks.

202
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,249
Well, you let me know
if you need backup.

203
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,418
- I got nothing to lose.
- I will.

204
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,260
- Look, baby...
- Don't call me that.

205
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,013
- Force of habit. Sorry.
- It's okay.

206
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Judy,

207
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,228
we can't change the past.

208
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,816
Now, I know this has been
really hard for you. I get it.

209
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,735
But I promise you,
if you tell Jen what happened,

210
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,738
you will only be making it worse
for her and for me.

211
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,670
I know you don't want that.

212
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:36,694
You don't
want to cause any more pain, do you?

213
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,036
You don't know what I want.

214
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,163
And I don't have to do your plan.

215
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,625
- You know, you're the one who left me.
- Judy, don't be stupid.

216
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,044
You're not my fiance anymore.

217
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,863
- You're not even my lawyer anymore.
- Judy, listen to me...

218
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,176
Oh, look! It's my friend.

219
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,053
- Okay. Judy?
- Sorry.

220
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,013
Judy!

221
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,182
I'm at work.

222
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,647
She just backed me into a corner.
I had no choice.

223
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,984
God, there's a lot
of fucking pinatas in here.

224
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,612
I'm surprised you opted
for the balloon release thing.

225
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,372
I thought that you
said it was "woo-woo."

226
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,997
It is. I'm repulsed by it, actually.

227
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:19,993
But there was no way
I was gonna let Lorna take over.

228
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,996
I mean, she is awful.

229
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,416
She is one of the world's
great narcissists.

230
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:28,183
- Oh, she's internationally recognized?
- Yes.

231
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,296
Oh, you should've seen her
at Ted's funeral.

232
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,423
It was her finest performance.

233
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,135
My son!

234
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,763
My baby boy!

235
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,806
My teddy bear!

236
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,482
He was dreading turning 50.

237
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,109
God, he would've hated all this shit.

238
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,407
I wish I could bring him back for you.

239
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,535
I know, but you can't.

240
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,372
Unless you know something
that I don't know.

241
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,793
Why don't I take over?

242
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,337
No, Judy. I decided to do this.
I have to...

243
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,506
No. Please. Come on.

244
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,643
Let me. I can whip something up.

245
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:17,426
It's totally in my wheelhouse.

246
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,304
Ew! I was in until you
said "wheelhouse."

247
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,889
Stop it. Come on.

248
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,515
Really?

249
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,394
Because I don't know if you can tell,
but this store is, like,

250
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,437
depressing the shit out of me.

251
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,022
I got it. I swear.

252
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,067
Lorna is gonna love it so much,
she's gonna die.

253
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,985
Mmm! You promise?

254
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,825
Off the computer, please.

255
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,994
Yo, bro!

256
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,830
- Ow!
- That did not hurt.

257
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,041
Please just turn it off, okay?
Your grandmother is gonna be here soon.

258
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:50,234
I don't want to.

259
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,378
I'm sorry.
What words did you just say to me?

260
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,715
I don't wanna do this memorial thing.

261
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:59,210
Okay. Well, you know what?
Neither do I, but we're still doing it.

262
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,352
Okay. Can I go now?

263
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,600
'Cause I'm in the middle of a campaign,
I'm playing with other people.

264
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,516
- What people?
- Game friends.

265
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,853
Wrath of Hades is multiplayer
and we're getting slaughtered.

266
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,938
Oh. That sounds fun.

267
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,732
Dad thought it was fun.

268
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,694
And he used to play with me.

269
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,947
Of course he played with you.

270
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,617
Yeah. His... laptop's right there.

271
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,103
If you want, you could
give it a try or...

272
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:27,571
You probably wouldn't get it.

273
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,874
We both know I would not.

274
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,375
- Yeah.
- Mom!

275
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,171
You have to come see the backyard.
Oh, my gosh. Dad is gonna love this!

276
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,551
Okay, let's do this.

277
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,685
Judy, seriously?

278
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:51,312
Is it okay?

279
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,440
No. It's ridiculous, in the best way.

280
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,065
Thank you.

281
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,904
Charlie, there's candy.

282
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:03,514
I think it's good we're doing this.

283
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,285
You know?
I think it'll be good for the boys.

284
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,037
I think it'll be good for everyone.

285
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,684
Look who I found
poking around outside your house.

286
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,251
I wasn't poking.

287
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,797
I noticed some dead spots on your lawn.
You need a gardener, Jennifer.

288
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,132
- I'll send Manuel over.
- No, I'm good.

289
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,052
We just got a third offer
on Steve's house, over asking.

290
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:24,638
That's because you priced it too low.

291
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:27,598
Uh. You could just say
congratulations, you know?

292
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,141
Congratulations.

293
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:36,166
Jennifer, I must compliment
you on your decorations.

294
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,432
They're "muy" tasteful.

295
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,484
Oh, well.

296
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:39,693
Gracias.

297
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,863
Uh, I actually cannot take credit
for any of this. It's...

298
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,532
Decorations are all Judy.

299
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,760
Oh. You hire well. That's also a skill.

300
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,903
Jesus Christ, Lorna. I didn't hire her.

301
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,331
She isn't your house girl?

302
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,794
No. Judy is a friend of mine
who is living with us.

303
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,037
Why didn't I know about this?

304
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,923
You know, Judy?
Can we get this balloon thing

305
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,486
- going before I...
- Oh, yeah.

306
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,610
- Come on, everybody...
- Stab this fucking bitch in the twat.

307
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,682
So, the idea is you write down something

308
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,159
that you wish you'd gotten the chance
to say to Ted, or your dad,

309
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,565
when he was still here.
Something you'd like him to know.

310
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,277
And we'll release them
to his spirit in the sky.

311
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,574
When you're ready,
you roll up your message...

312
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,494
and work it into the balloon's hole.

313
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,665
- Okay.
- I don't know how I'm supposed to fit

314
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:38,669
a lifetime of feeling
onto one tiny piece of paper.

315
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,091
- Mommy, aren't you gonna write one?
- Yes, of course, babe.

316
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,261
Oh, Judy, you have to write one too.

317
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,222
And say what? She never met him.

318
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,766
My son!

319
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,269
My baby boy!

320
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,438
My teddy bear!

321
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,291
You just uh...

322
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,121
Oh! God.

323
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,331
Oh, hi.

324
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,834
You're very pretty.

325
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,836
Oh, thank you.

326
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,339
You're a very curious
kind of person, aren't you?

327
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,758
Where'd she find you?

328
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:56,098
Uh... At a grief support group thing.
Um...

329
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,684
Friends of Heaven.

330
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,018
I see.

331
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,354
And you were homeless at the time?

332
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,459
Come again?

333
00:17:04,493 --> 00:17:06,141
Jennifer told me you
were living with her

334
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,735
and the boys. Seems very quick.

335
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,406
So, I assumed you must have been...
in need.

336
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,830
Jen's just a very generous person.

337
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,051
Is there anything else?

338
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Or...

339
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,138
do you want a glass of wine?

340
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:40,309
You know, Ted was a musician.
Naturally gifted.

341
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,312
But his true job
was as a stay-at-home father.

342
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,272
He did the majority of the parenting.

343
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,275
Mothering never came naturally
to Jennifer.

344
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,694
That's not true.

345
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,362
Jen is a wonderful mother.

346
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,697
Well...

347
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,992
now who's being generous?

348
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,582
Would you mind helping
me with something?

349
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Sure.

350
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,011
♪ Happy birthday to Ted ♪

351
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:20,599
♪ Happy birthday to Ted ♪

352
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,687
♪ Happy birthday, dear Ted ♪

353
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,067
♪ Happy birthday to Ted ♪

354
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,320
Wow. Lorna, I mean,
this cake is wonderfully specific.

355
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,865
Mmm. Well, it's Teddy's
christening portrait.

356
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,035
I have a client who creates them.
She's phenomenal.

357
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,962
- Should we do the balloons now?
- Yeah.

358
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,088
What do you...
Like, one at a time or...?

359
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,958
I think we do them all at once

360
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:50,170
and then we have a quiet moment
of reflection as they drift away.

361
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,922
- I could say a prayer.
- No.

362
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,552
- Oh... Fine.
- Yeah?

363
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,636
Yeah. Fine.

364
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,470
Just hold my hand.

365
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,516
Oh, we're holding? All right.

366
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,689
Heavenly Father, you showed us
where two or more are gathered,

367
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,357
you are always with us.

368
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,902
We gather here today to celebrate Ted.

369
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,155
Hello?

370
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,826
Sorry to interrupt the party.
We rang the doorbell.

371
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,787
- Uh. Mrs. Harding, can we have a word?
- Oh, yeah.

372
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,958
Hi.

373
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,210
Did you find something?

374
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:31,894
Okay. I have been here before.

375
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,802
- I remember where I...
- Is this about my son?

376
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,425
Did you find the lunatic
who was driving the car?

377
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,715
- No, ma'am.
- We should talk inside.

378
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,683
This is about the car
you called me about the other day.

379
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,726
What about it?

380
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,022
- Someone took a golf club to it.
- Did they?

381
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,692
Obviously, it's a coincidence
that you called, let's go with

382
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,196
"screaming at me," about the exact
same car right before it was...

383
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,531
You know what? I'm so...
Gosh. I'm so sorry.

384
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,492
Uh... It's just
this is not really a great time.

385
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:03,827
Just, we're...

386
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,911
We're having a birthday party
for my dead husband, so...

387
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,249
Oh. That's really nice
you're doing something.

388
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,403
Mrs. Harding,
I have a heavily vandalized car.

389
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:14,588
And although I have a hunch,
I need to know who...

390
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,841
You know what I need to know?
I need to know who killed my husband.

391
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,470
All right? So what?
So some car gets fucked up,

392
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,013
- and you come after me?
- Language.

393
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,514
- That's not fair.
- Fair?

394
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:28,060
Lady, there is a murderer on the loose
and you guys have done nothing!

395
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,642
You wanna talk about fair?

396
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,553
I wanna talk about where
you were two nights ago.

397
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:33,148
And it's Detective, not lady.

398
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,484
Oh, God. So, you come here

399
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,528
because some dickhead
lost his windshield, Detective?

400
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,489
Well, I lost my husband.

401
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,574
- Just tell me who...
- You tell me.

402
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,950
Who did it?

403
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,869
Who did it?

404
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,536
Who did it?

405
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
I did it.

406
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,712
It was me.

407
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,093
I destroyed that Corvette.

408
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,236
I saw the guy speeding, and he could've

409
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:05,338
hurt someone and then Jen was so upset.

410
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,766
So, I went out and I found that car

411
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,893
all by myself, and I just...

412
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,771
went nuts on it.

413
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:19,538
- All right.
- She went nuts.

414
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,616
- Hey. I'll be right behind you, okay?
- No. Stay.

415
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,620
I'm not gonna let you sit
in some police station.

416
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,830
I have a lawyer, I'll be fine.
Please, go do the balloons.

417
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,832
I'm okay. Thank you.

418
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,107
- Watch your step.
- This is a nice car.

419
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,717
- Are you okay?
- I will be. Give me this. Thank you.

420
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,637
You invited a violent criminal
into your home.

421
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,081
She's not a criminal, Lorna.

422
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,766
She's a confessed violent criminal,

423
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,394
living under your roof
with my grandchildren.

424
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,871
You know what, she actually
lives in the guesthouse,

425
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:55,680
so technically she lives
under Ted's roof.

426
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,025
- And what would Ted say?
- I don't know, Lorna.

427
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:02,154
I can't ask him that question,
but my friend is not a criminal.

428
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,529
Okay?

429
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,954
She's the only person
who has been here for me.

430
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,356
The only person that doesn't make me

431
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:10,236
feel like I am failing at everything,

432
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,830
including being a widow.

433
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,625
She cares about me.
She cares about the boys.

434
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,588
And so what? So she...
she smashed up a car.

435
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,089
You know what? Sometime you just snap!

436
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:25,093
- Okay. Wow.
- How dare you!

437
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,389
Hey, boys?

438
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,142
Get in here and punch that cake.
It's really fun.

439
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,852
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

440
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,487
I'm sure. I want you to
come destroy the cake.

441
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,440
- I don't wanna punch the cake.
- That's my sweet boy.

442
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,025
I want Judy to come back.

443
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,235
You know what?
Judy would want you to punch the cake.

444
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,738
Come on. Get in here. Let's do this.

445
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,658
- There you go, get in there.
- Oh, wow.

446
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,826
Yeah. Beat it up.

447
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,792
Of all the days,
you pick this one to hurt me?

448
00:22:56,953 --> 00:22:57,953
You know what?

449
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:01,194
Lighten up, Lorna.
Look, it's a birthday party.

450
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,342
- I thought you said it was a memorial.
- Well, you know what I remember?

451
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:06,967
Hmm.

452
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,680
...is that I loved Ted and he loved me,

453
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:13,308
and we had a really good marriage.

454
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,687
And the only reason we ever had
any problems was because of you.

455
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:25,529
We both know your marriage
was far from perfect.

456
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,740
You don't know anything
about my marriage.

457
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,577
He called me. The night he died.

458
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,121
Ted called me.

459
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,581
Shall we talk about that?

460
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,794
Go home, Lorna.

461
00:23:45,415 --> 00:23:48,418
And the golf club you used on
the car, where did you get it?

462
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,179
God. I don't remember.

463
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,848
You an avid golfer?

464
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,098
No.

465
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,018
So you just carry around
a golf club at night,

466
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,808
nowhere near a golf course, just in case

467
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:00,805
you find something you
might wanna smash with it?

468
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,067
Yes. Yes, exactly.

469
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,361
Thank you.

470
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,405
All right. Ms. Hale,

471
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,284
let me remind you that you are
confessing to a criminal act.

472
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:16,086
If you didn't do it, it would be
in your best interest to tell me now.

473
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,873
So, I'm gonna ask you again.

474
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,959
Did you do it?

475
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,547
I did it.

476
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,346
I did it.

477
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,270
And you have no idea how sorry I am.

478
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,985
Lord, make me
an instrument of your peace.

479
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,238
Where there is hatred, let me sow love.

480
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,533
Where there is injury, pardon.

481
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,496
Where there is darkness, light.

482
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,832
For it is in giving that we receive.

483
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,710
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.

484
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:08,548
It is in dying that we are born
to eternal life.

485
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:10,014
Amen.

486
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:13,428
All right.
Let's release the balloons, guys. Okay?

487
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:17,057
- In three, two, one.
- Two, one...

488
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,140
Go.

489
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,736
- So, is that it?
- Yup. I think so.

490
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,614
I thought something
magical would happen.

491
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,867
It's just not that kind of day, Boop.

492
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,050
- I know what you're gonna say.
- Are you trying to get caught?

493
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,163
No.

494
00:25:46,197 --> 00:25:49,214
Well then please. You don't
have to follow every impulse.

495
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:52,290
- It is possible to have a bad idea.
- Okay. Thank you for coming.

496
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,994
I was at dinner with my parents.

497
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:55,896
I had to lie and tell
them my tummy hurt.

498
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,265
You could've come up with
a better lie, you're 44.

499
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,101
Well, I panicked, okay?
You almost gave me a heart attack.

500
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,062
Well, it really wasn't very pleasant
for me, either.

501
00:26:04,152 --> 00:26:05,696
Oh, you didn't like jail? Try prison.

502
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,441
I know. Oh, God.

503
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,237
Thank you.
I appreciate you taking care of it.

504
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:21,913
Listen, whether we like it or not,
we're both in this thing together.

505
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,710
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

506
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,590
You're right. I can't tell her.

507
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,217
I don't wanna make
anyone's life any worse.

508
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,301
Hey.

509
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,344
Baby.

510
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,973
You just listen to me.

511
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,017
Trust me.

512
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,644
It'll all be okay.

513
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,353
Okay.

514
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,690
I got you.

515
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,569
I got you.

516
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,862
Oh!

517
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,756
Well, look who's back.

518
00:27:39,768 --> 00:27:41,159
Happy birthday, baby.

519
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,704
