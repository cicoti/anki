1
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,480
-What are you doing?
-Well, I didn't want to disturb you.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,240
-What do you mean?
-I was gonna come in and eat at the table,

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,720
but I didn't know if you was busy
so I'm having it here.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,880
But those aren't the only two options,
are they,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,440
eat in my house
or just outside my house?

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,800
-There's the rest of the fucking world.
-All right, don't get the hump!

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,760
So, did you talk to that bird about me?

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,680
Yeah.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
She'll meet up...

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,200
for a meal, or whatever.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,400
-[Pat] Really?
-Yeah.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,680
-And you was honest about me?
-[Tony] Pretty much.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,800
What, and she still wants to meet me?
What's the catch?

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,360
Well, she wanted me to be honest
about her to you as well.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,000
She's a sex worker.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,800
-A prossie?
-Yeah.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,840
Result!

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,000
-[slurps]
-You're not bothered?

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,000
She ain't got AIDS, has she?

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,720
Would that be a deal-breaker?

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,160
No.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,000
No, she hasn't got AIDS.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,240
-And she's lovely, and smart, and funny.
-She'll earn a few quid for that an' all.

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,400
Just split the bill.

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,360
-Lovely jubbly.
-[Tony] Right, OK...

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,360
-[slurping]
-Off we go.

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,320
Why?

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,040
'Cause it's weird,
a postman having a picnic in your garden.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,280
What's weird about it?

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,400
Get out.

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,120
Where's all this coming from?

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
[gentle music plays]

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,760
Out! Fuckin' hell.

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,720
[kids laughing and squealing]

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,360
You all right, George?

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,640
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,520
Are Mum and Dad getting a divorce?

38
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
I don't know.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,040
I want them to still be my mum and dad.

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,680
Whatever happens,
even if they're not always together,

41
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,880
they'll still be your mum and dad,
and love you, and...

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,360
be an even better mum and dad,

43
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,000
you can play them off against each other,
get anything you want.

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,760
-What toy do you want?
-Dunno.

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,640
Well, think big. I reckon
you'll be able to get a quad bike.

46
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,000
Maybe even a crossbow,
if you play your cards right. [chuckles]

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,680
You'll be living the dream.

48
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,200
You'll be like, "Mum, Dad,
I'm off down the pub. Don't wait up."

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,400
[both giggle]

50
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
It'll be fine.

51
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,280
-[boy] Hi, George.
-[George] Hi.

52
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,960
-Morning.
-Oh, happy birthday!

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,560
-How did you know?
-It's on your records.

54
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,840
-Oh, yeah.
-[Valerie] Any plans?

55
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,760
Just a meal at home with my family.

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,280
-Who will cook, your mum or your dad?
-Me.

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,760
Well, happy birthday.

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Thank you.

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,480
Happy birthday!

60
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Thank you.

61
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,080
-Cup of tea, then?
-Yes, please.

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,280
No, you make it.

63
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
Why?

64
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,520
You're the work experience.
You have to start at the bottom.

65
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,440
It's Sandy's birthday,
make her a cup of tea.

66
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
It's your birthday?

67
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,440
Er, yeah.

68
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,800
-[Tony] Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

69
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,160
Is there going to be cake?

70
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,400
Just make the tea!

71
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,600
God!

72
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,600
-Is there gonna be any cake, though?
-[snorts]

73
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,720
So, you're a Virgo?

74
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,680
-Yeah.
-[Kath] Yeah.

75
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,440
Do your horoscope for you if you like?

76
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
Nah, 'cause it's pointless.

77
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,280
-It's not pointless, actually.
-How can people born around the same time,

78
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,920
from all over the world,
share similar traits just because of that?

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,480
-It's rubbish.
-It's true!

80
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,000
Virgos are smart, modest,

81
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,320
capable, dedicated.

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
See? Fits, don't it?

83
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,240
Yeah, everyone likes to think
they're those things!

84
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,640
That's why they make it flattering,
so you believe it. If it said,

85
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,040
"Oh, you're boring, ugly, thick,
and shit at everything,"

86
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,400
you wouldn't go back, would ya?

87
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Also, they make it vague
so you can make it fit.

88
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,320
I want to see one in the paper that says,
"Happy birthday, Rita Wainthrope

89
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,320
of 7 Acacia Drive, Wigan.

90
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,480
You're going to get fired
from your job today

91
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,880
'cause everyone hates you
and the boss thinks you're a slut."

92
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,040
Then I'd believe it.

93
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,720
-Always have to get silly, don't you?
-[sniggers]

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,000
You all right?

95
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
[glumly] Yeah.

96
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,360
I'm just... feeling a bit...

97
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,960
I dunno... 30.

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,360
Yeah, I hated 30.

99
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
Quite liked 40.

100
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,280
Fifty was all right.

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,120
It's not your age, is it?
It's what's happening...

102
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
in your life.

103
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Not a lot.

104
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,600
Do you want to go for a coffee?

105
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,240
-Yeah.
-Come on, then.

106
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,440
Do you know what my parents got me
for my birthday?

107
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
A set of saucepans and a super mop.

108
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,040
[chuckles]

109
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,440
What's super about it?

110
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,760
It's got an ultra-absorbent sponge head.

111
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,600
-It cleans, dries, and absorbs in one go.
-Sure.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,960
Do you know how?

113
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,080
-Wring-Max technology.
-[laughs]

114
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,800
For maximum wringing. [chuckles]

115
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,960
Good.

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,960
I feel bad whinging to you.

117
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,320
My problems probably seem so trivial.

118
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,880
No, not at all.

119
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,320
Also...

120
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,080
I've been wanting to apologize
for something I said once too.

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,640
What?

122
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,760
When I asked you to be happy.

123
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,480
I realized it's a stupid thing to say.

124
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
No, it's...

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,320
You wanted me to be happy.

126
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
I get it.

127
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,640
People think that...

128
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,440
all those things I miss doing with Lisa,

129
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,480
I could just do them anyway,
and it'll make me feel better.

130
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,840
But, um... they're missing the point.

131
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,120
I don't miss doing things with Lisa,

132
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,640
I miss doing nothing... with Lisa.

133
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,680
Do you know what I mean?
Just... sitting at home,

134
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,480
wouldn't even have to go out,
or do anything, or even talk,

135
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,600
you know, just...

136
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
sitting there, knowing she was there.

137
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,480
Sometimes, I'd just look over at her.

138
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,800
-This has turned out well again.
-[strained chuckle]

139
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,080
-[Sandy sighs]
-Ah...

140
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,040
So, does it do lino, and tiles, and wood?

141
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,200
It does everything.

142
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,480
-Brilliant!
-Yeah.

143
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,600
-[laughter]
-[Simon] What do you drive?

144
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,400
It's a little Mini...

145
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,520
But I don't drive it now,
I'm trying to minimize--

146
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,520
-Hiya.
-Hi.

147
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,480
Hiya, just... Simon, isn't it?

148
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,280
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Tony.

149
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,960
You're here a lot.

150
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,880
-Yeah, my mum's in here.
-Oh, right.

151
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,440
Yeah, it breaks my heart.
They all break my heart, I love 'em all.

152
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,240
I wish I could take them all home.

153
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,440
-[Simon chuckles]
-Aw... That's sweet.

154
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,560
Maybe start with your mum first,
take her home, and...

155
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,440
Yeah, I can't,
not with my circumstances at the moment.

156
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,440
-[Tony] Oh.
-[Simon] I do what I can.

157
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,920
Maybe everyone's in the same boat.

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,400
-Yeah, sure.
-[Tony] Yeah.

159
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,880
Nice to meet ya.

160
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,680
-Yeah.
-Okay.

161
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,840
See you later, babe.

162
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,400
[Tony] Fuckin' hell!

163
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,960
What?

164
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,760
Him.

165
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,880
What about him?

166
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,080
He's doing his...
"sensitive man" thing, isn't he?

167
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,920
He's trying to be all kind and lovely
to you, to impress you.

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,600
I don't know. Call me old-fashioned,

169
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,760
but it kinda works,
being kind and lovely.

170
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,400
-It's fake!
-[scoffs]

171
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,480
He probably works in a bank
and has people's houses repossessed.

172
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,040
-[chuckles]
-He's doing his...

173
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,120
[mockingly] "Oh, you know, I'm so caring
in a cruel world, in't I?"

174
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,040
-His... "Oh, isn't famine awful?"
-[sniggers]

175
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,520
"I'd like to take them all
to McDonald's, babe."

176
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,360
-[giggles]
-[Tony sniggers]

177
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Stop it!

178
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,120
Oh...

179
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,360
Well... I don't feel the same about him
the way I do about you.

180
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,280
Good.

181
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,040
But, well...
you're not an option, are you?

182
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,560
I think you're brilliant, Tony, and...

183
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,960
But at least he doesn't go on
about another woman the way you do.

184
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,040
And I know... I understand, Tony,
I get why you do, and it's...

185
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,520
it's lovely, it really is.

186
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,240
But I don't want to be the other woman.

187
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,040
Oh, did I blow it? Sorry, I...

188
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,920
It's fine, really.
There's no need to be sorry. It's...

189
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,920
I like this, though. I love this.

190
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Whatever this is.

191
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,080
Just being with you... all the time,

192
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
the same...

193
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,000
forever...

194
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,800
like <i>Groundhog Day.</i> [chuckles]

195
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,920
[chuckles sadly]

196
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Yeah, well...

197
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,880
I get all that, but...

198
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,640
not everyone's the same, Tony.

199
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,600
Right.

200
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,000
[wistful music plays]

201
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,240
[nurse chuckles wryly]

202
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,560
I don't know whether to psychoanalyze you

203
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,000
or take you down the vet
and get you fucking put down.

204
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,480
You gotta get out there, mate.

205
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,600
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

206
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,360
Dunk the monk.

207
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,960
Bang some beaver.
Shoot some <i>Schpritz.</i>

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,240
What's that?

209
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,680
It's Yiddish for spunk.

210
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,360
Oh, right.

211
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,360
Listen, the offer's still open if you want
to come out with me and the boys.

212
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,840
We're actually getting messy tonight,
as it goes.

213
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,520
Local pub crawl and a minge hunt.

214
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,520
Um... That's a very kind offer,

215
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,680
but I can't tonight, unfortunately.

216
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,840
Poof!

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,120
[cat purring]

218
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,840
He's asking who you are.

219
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,720
They're from the local newspaper.
[chuckles]

220
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,920
So...

221
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,920
when did you... first discover
you could speak to cats?

222
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,680
Well, it was not long
after my daughter died.

223
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,040
Um... he was her cat, you see.

224
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,000
And I just started talking to him
about missing Jenny, and...

225
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,160
we bonded.

226
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,560
It's nice to have someone who understands.

227
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,520
Yep... [sighs]

228
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
...it is.

229
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,840
Uh... what's his name?

230
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,760
-[woman] Frank.
-Frank.

231
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,000
She named him after her dad.

232
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,320
That's my husband.

233
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,320
[inhales shakily] He passed away
a couple of years before Jenny.

234
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Would you like another cup of tea?

235
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,600
Uh...

236
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,160
No, thanks. Um...

237
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,280
Uh... can we take a quick picture?

238
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Oh, yeah.

239
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,120
[camera clicks]

240
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,000
-Great.
-[woman] Is that it, then?

241
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Yeah.

242
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,280
Um...

243
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,880
Are you hungry?
I could make you something to eat.

244
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,720
No. No, thanks.

245
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,000
[sadly] Oh, all right, then.

246
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,480
-[Tony] Thanks very much.
-Thank you.

247
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
-[Tony] Right, bye-bye.
-Bye-bye. Thank you.

248
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,240
[Tony] That's so sad.

249
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,920
-[Lenny] She's happy enough.
-[Tony] No, she's not.

250
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,080
She wants to tell her story.

251
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,960
She wants to see her husband
and her daughter's name in the paper.

252
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,520
The cat thing's just an in.

253
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
She's lonely.

254
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,240
-Did you forget something?
-[Tony] Um...

255
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,000
Sorry about your husband and daughter.

256
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,680
-[sentimental music plays]
-Oh, thank you.

257
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,360
Frank and Jenny?

258
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,360
Yes.

259
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,160
Bye-bye.

260
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,840
Oh, bye-bye. Thank you.

261
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,280
If I could live till he's 50,
that would make me happy.

262
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,280
I don't think he'll live longer than that,
to be honest. Think he'd struggle.

263
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,080
He struggles now.

264
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,560
Roger Realms.

265
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
Have I told you about him?
Roger by name, Roger by nature?

266
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,200
Who's Roger Realms?

267
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,160
Agent. Used to work with him.

268
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Would only sign black lads.

269
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,200
I'd often wander into Roger's
dressing room, and there he'd be

270
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,080
with some boy hanging off him,
he was basically an arse peg.

271
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,120
Went early doors with AIDS,
but good luck to him, you know.

272
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,040
God bless you, Roger.

273
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,200
I've run a few
of these little local newspapers

274
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,480
around the country. I know
that doesn't make me Rupert Murdoch.

275
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,440
But this is the only one
that loses money.

276
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,960
-Is it?
-Effectively, yes.

277
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,880
I mean, I own the building,
so it's not a massive problem.

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Look, the fact is, uh... I'm semi-retired.

279
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,480
And I'm wondering is it...

280
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,400
is it worth the headache?

281
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,600
I mean, I'm just thinking
I could throw in the towel.

282
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,520
Sell the property and get a nice lump sum.

283
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,680
Could you give us more time,
do you think?

284
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,360
[inhales sharply] Uh...

285
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,880
Just if we could...

286
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,560
-make more money, then...
-Look--

287
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,000
-We could find a way, I'm sure.
-OK.

288
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,560
I mean, it's going to take a bit of time
to sell the property,

289
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,600
get all the paperwork right. Um...

290
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,280
And if you can...

291
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,080
Well, if you can make me an offer
I can't refuse, yes, then I'll look at it.

292
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,400
But quite frankly, I...

293
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,520
I'm sorry,
but I really don't see that happening.

294
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,840
-Sorry.
-No, I'm sorry...

295
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,040
that we're not making much money.

296
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,160
-[Matt] So, speak soon.
-[owner] OK, thank you.

297
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,720
OK, everyone? Um...

298
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,680
Listen up. That was Mr. Middleton, Paul.

299
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,280
Some of you know, he, um, owns everything:
the paper and the building.

300
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,160
Um...

301
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,320
He wants to stop running the paper.

302
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,880
What, sell it?

303
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,320
[Matt] Well, he wants to...

304
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,280
um... close the paper,

305
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,360
and then sell the building.

306
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,920
He'll sell it to a property developer.
This will be luxury flats.

307
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,000
[Kath] Well, I'll be all right.

308
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,760
Tambury Brewery have already said
they'd take me on.

309
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,720
Think the boss fancies me.

310
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,760
Right. Well...

311
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,760
Well, that's the end
of <i>The Tambury Gazette,</i> kids.

312
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Don't worry,

313
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,720
we'll all just get another shitty job
that barely pays enough to live.

314
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,280
[Sandy]
This is the only job I've ever liked.

315
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,000
I've got to have a job.

316
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,040
My mum's disabled.

317
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,760
And my daddy can't work.

318
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,680
My brother and sister, they're in school,
and they get nothing as it is.

319
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,600
-OK.
-So I've got to go find another job

320
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,080
-that I'll hate. Again.
-[Tony] OK.

321
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,480
-Well, we'll save the paper, and...
-How?

322
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,000
We'll get more revenue. Kath'll get more.

323
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,440
-How?
-[Tony] 'Cause you're really...

324
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,240
good at your... job. You'll charge more
for advertising, like...

325
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,880
Tambury Brewery,
they'll pay more, won't they?

326
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,840
Or we get a loan.

327
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,640
Happens all the time.
We get a loan... We'll buy the...

328
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,200
building, and then we'll pay back the loan
with the profit from the...

329
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,760
the paper, and pay ourselves a wage,

330
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
and that'll be... then, it'll be our...

331
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,000
business to make it... work.

332
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,800
So, don't worry. [taps keyboard idly]

333
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,120
[choking back tears] You promise?

334
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,760
[Sandy sniffles]

335
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,760
You... you'll save the paper?

336
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,880
Yeah, I will.

337
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,240
-[Sandy] OK.
-We will.

338
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
[mournful music plays]

339
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,760
[Tony] Hmm.

340
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
How are you?

341
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,800
[halfheartedly] Yeah... you know.

342
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,840
That's pretty positive coming from you.
[chuckling]

343
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,120
I was trying to be all British
and not burden you with my... troubles.

344
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,440
Well, us British love gossip.

345
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,560
So, spill the beans.

346
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,080
Same, really. I'm... still a bit mental.

347
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,040
Trying hard to care about stuff.

348
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,360
And then today,

349
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,400
we find out that the owner of the paper,

350
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,600
he's selling up and...

351
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,920
we'll all lose our jobs.

352
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,840
Oh, no.

353
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,720
That's not the bad bit.
I was fine with that.

354
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,920
But then Sandy starts crying
'cause it's the only job she's ever liked,

355
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,760
and so, I've got to try
and save the paper for her sake.

356
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,000
And my brother-in-law, who was sleeping
on the floor of the office,

357
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,400
is now sleeping at Lenny's council house

358
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,440
'cause Lenny's shacked up with June,

359
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,760
who persuaded him
to give her fat kid a job at the paper.

360
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Just think, if I'd have killed myself,
I'd have missed all this.

361
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,600
[Anne chuckles]

362
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,920
[Matt] Brainstorming session.

363
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,640
How do we turn the paper around?
How do we make it more profitable?

364
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,080
We need to go more tabloid.

365
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,600
Gossip, celebrity stuff, fashion.
Who looks shit an' that, you know?

366
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,040
"Who looks shit an' that"?

367
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,400
Yeah.

368
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,240
Well, pictures of cellulite,
that kind of thing.

369
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,720
You know, amazing stories.

370
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Paranormal, weird stuff.

371
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,160
I love that.

372
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,720
-Right.
-[Tony] Right.

373
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,520
You want tabloid,
you want to speak to my agent, Ken.

374
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,280
Yeah, we did. He's mental.

375
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,440
Well, we could run the Liberace story.

376
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,240
N-No, we couldn't.

377
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,880
-Well, what is it?
-His agent reckons

378
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,040
-he was bummed by the ghost of Liberace.
-[Lenny] Mm-hmm.

379
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,320
-Well, it might be true.
-How the fuck can it be true?

380
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,440
We don't know everything

381
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,160
-about the paranormal.
-Lot of weird stuff.

382
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,840
Right. It's all about belief, isn't it?

383
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,000
You know, that's not up to us,
what people believe.

384
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,440
Papers are always covering
religious miracles and stuff.

385
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,400
-Yeah, and they're always bollocks.
-It's not for us to say.

386
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,040
It is for us to say, we're writing it.

387
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,360
Yeah, but we're only reporting
what was said.

388
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,560
-Right.
-Ghosts do exist, though.

389
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,320
Loads of people have seen 'em,
and there's no other explanation.

390
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,840
Well, there is another explanation:

391
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,760
they haven't seen them
'cause they don't exist.

392
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,200
How about that one?

393
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,360
No one has ever turned into a ghost.

394
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,920
When you die, they burn you or bury you,
you never exist again, the end.

What'd you do that for?

You look sad.

-Right!
-Oh, that's a waste.

416
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,640
Right, OK.
I don't think this is helping, though.

-[Brian] Huh?
-[James] Delicious.

432
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,480
I can't understand a word you're saying,
but I love watching you eat.

433
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,920
-Oh!
-You're like a fat toad eating a big worm.

434
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,680
A big creamy worm.

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,160
Hmm?

436
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,040
Will you come for a drink with me tonight?

-I prefer to drink alone.
-[Matt] I know.

438
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,960
I'm just saying as a favor. Please?
I still want to talk to people.

439
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,600
The only person who listens
is my therapist, and I have to pay him.

440
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,600
-And he's an idiot.
-Right.

441
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,480
I only want to talk to you.

442
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,000
And Jill, obviously,
but that's not possible at the moment.

443
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,320
My life's falling apart, Tony.

444
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,440
I go from sleeping on the floor
of my office to taking Lenny's flat,

445
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,200
and in return,
I give his fat stepson a job

446
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,840
at a paper that I'm now gonna lose.

447
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,560
It's, like, the final straw.

448
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,480
Well...

449
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,800
actually, being needed is...

450
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,600
is a good thing.

451
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,000
You helped a mate

452
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,240
with his relationship,
gave his fat kid a job, you should be...

453
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,960
proud of yourself.

454
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,560

you're making me feel better already.

00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,680
Come on! What's the matter with you?

510
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,200
I should go check on Tony.

511
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,480
Go on, then.
Bang some beaver for us, yeah?

512
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,320
[Nonce] Yeah, go on.
Have a good night.

513
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,920
-Size of that mushroom!
-[Roxy chuckles]

514
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,680
It's like a quarter...
Only a quarter of it.

515
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,440
It's good value, innit, for you?

516
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,400
This was 13 quid.

517
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,680
[Roxy laughs]

518
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,360
[laughs]
No, I'm serious. This was 13 quid.

519
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,480
So, how comes you're single, then?

520
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,520
'Cause I used to be twice this size.

521
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,680
[chuckles lightly]

522
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,200
[Pat] No, I'm serious.

523
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,760
At my heaviest...

524
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,040
about 24 stone.

525
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,160
I lost it all, didn't I,
when I became a postman.

526
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,160
I think big blokes are sexy.

527
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,880
No, I was an absolute mess.

528
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,560
I was a car crash under there.
I've still got a lot of loose skin, but...

529
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,360
-I'm saving up to get it sorted.
-[chuckles]

530
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,080
[laughs] No, I'm serious.
It's 'orrible down there. 'Orrible.

531
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Really bad.

532
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,960
I'm loving this.

533
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,680
[Roxy] Risotto? It's good!

534
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,920
No, this...

535
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,640
the date.

536
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,800
I'm enjoying it as well.

537
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,760
You know, I know you're out of my league
and that, but... ahh! Yeah.

538
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,120
No, it's good. It's been fun.

539
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
-Fuckin' hell.
-Maybe he's right, though.

540
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,000
Maybe I should bang some beaver.

541
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,760
Bang some...?

542
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,440
Bang some beaver. His words, not mine.

543
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,880
Yeah, exactly. They're his words,

544
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,560
they should never be said
by any other human being.

545
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,800
[Tony] Fuckin' hell.

546
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,440
Can't hurt, though, can it?

547
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,040
-What?
-[Matt sighs]

548
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,680
Chatting up a girl.

549
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,120
"Chatting up a girl"?

550
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,800
What about those two over there?
Don't look.

551
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,000
No. No.

552
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,920
They've come here for a quiet drink.
To talk to each other.

553
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,480
-Not to be chatted up by you.
-Why not? Come on, come over with me.

554
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,440
No, no, no, no!

555
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,640
-Please?
-No.

556
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,680
Just sit over there with me.
Not to make a move, just sit at the table.

557
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,600
So, to talk to each other and drink?
Not to bother any...

558
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,520
Yeah.

559
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,480
All right.

560
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,160
[indistinct chattering]

561
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,560
Uh, anyone sitting here?

562
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,440
-Er, no, go for it.
-Great.

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,160
[funky beat plays]

564
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,160
-This is pretty funky, isn't it?
-Sit down!

565
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,360
[Tony] Please.

566
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,080
OK.

567
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,400
Right.

568
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,400
-Um... Are you--
-No.

569
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,720

570
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,720
Er, yeah.

572
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,280
Just to say, you can relax.

573

Uh... we're not married men...

574
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,200
as such. We're... I <i>am</i> married.

575
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,040
Um, but I'm separated.
Getting divorced, probably.

576
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,320
Um...

577
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,920
Tony's wife's died.

578
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,680
Um... of cancer.

579
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,120
So, it's totally, uh, legitimate.

580
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,200
What is?

581
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,760
Just talking to us. It's not--

582
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,760
Sorry.

583
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,640
Yeah, and how's your mum?

584
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,760
[Tony sighs deeply]

585
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,480
-I think I'm out of practice.
-You reckon?

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
-'Cause that was...
-Hi.

-Hi.
-[Simon] Hi.

588
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,520
-Oh, you've, uh, met... Tony, I think.
-[Tony] Yeah.

589
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,440

-[Tony] Yep.

-[grunting, splattering]

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,120
I reckon we've spent about the same,
so that's worked out.

596
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,480
We said we was going to go halves,
didn't we?

597
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Let me get it.

-No, no, no...
-Let me get it.

-I'd like to get it.
-No.

Let's go halves.

And I tell you what, how about you pay
for the whole thing next time?

Don't be sorry, it's nice.

-Yeah.

-Yeah.

Not till early morning.

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,560
I might bump into you, then.
