1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,560
-[Lisa]<i> Yes. Come and dance with me.</i>
<i>-I'm fucking hot.</i>

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,680
<i>-Come on.</i>
<i>-I'm too hot.</i>

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,640
<i>-Before you're too pissed to stand.</i>
<i>-Fuck's sake.</i>

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,840
<i>Please! Come on.</i>

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,120
<i>We can tango.</i>

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,560
<i>-Oh, God! Come on!</i>
<i>-</i>[Lisa laughs]

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,760
[Lisa] <i>Yeah!</i>

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,960
[yells delightedly]

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,600
[guests cheering]

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,680
[Lisa] <i>Yes!</i>

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,760
[Lisa shrieks, giggles]

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,200
<i>He didn't drop me!</i>

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,960
[Lisa] <i>Cheers!</i>

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
[Brandy whimpers]

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,520
Come on, then.

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
Yeah.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,840
Oh...

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,600
Here.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,680
Yeah.

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
Whose is that?

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,600
Brandy's breakfast, innit?

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,600
Come on.

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Come here.

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Good girl.

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,040
Another day. Gotta keep it together.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,640
Face the world.

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,640
[doorbell rings]

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
Just to let you know,
I got the flat share.

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,840
Oh... Good.

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,520
-So, the bath did the trick, didn't it?
-Who'd have thought it?

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Maybe wash again someday.
Sky's the limit.

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,240
My life's finally on the up.

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,120
It's given me a new sense of confidence
if I'm honest.

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Not much, but... it helps.

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,520
Oh, yeah. Who's that bird
I saw you with the other day?

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,160
Coming out of 'ere. Lovely sort.

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,760
-What bird?
-Blond. Really tasty.

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,280
Not yours, is she?

39
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,400
Oh. No.

40
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,760
Roxy.

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,320
Do you mind if I have a punt?

42
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,880
Don't get as much action
as you might think.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,400
-I'll put in a word.
-Well, don't big me up too much,

44
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,200
she'll be pretty disappointed as it is.
You know, if anything, downplay it.

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,320
-Downplay you?
-Yeah.

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,800
How would that go?

47
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,040
Dunno. What d'you think?

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,280
I'd have to say,

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,120
"He looks like summat
police would drag out of a river."

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,440
Yeah, but not the posh bit of a river.

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,800
You know, something near a sewage works
or something.

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,960
Any mail?

53
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
No, don't think so.

54
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,560
Good. Cheers.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,400
Ta-ra. See ya, mate.

56
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,200
Sorry about the...
thing with the meditation.

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,720
-He knows it wasn't your fault.
-Yeah.

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,200
It was his. For being an annoying prick.

59
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,120
Listen, Tony,
had you been drinking before that?

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,920
No. I had to have a little one after
to calm down.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
<i>-</i>But--
-Right.

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,200
-And that was his fault too, I imagine?
-No.

63
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,120
Not just his.
Most things are a good excuse for a drink.

64
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,960
I've always got drunk,
but I used to drink when I was happy,

65
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,600
and... that was all right,

66
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,680
but now I drink when I'm sad,
and that's not so good 'cause it...

67
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,160
happens more often
and a little bit earlier.

68
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
Just stop, then.

69
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,400
-Brilliant!
-Come on, it's serious.

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,600
If you've got a problem,
you should go to AA, or rehab, or--

71
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,520
[Tony] Why?

72
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
To get better.

73
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,880
Drinking isn't my illness, is it?

74
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,360
-Well, no, but it's bad for you.
-Everything's bad for you.

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,480
We're all dying.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,280
Being healthy is just dying more slowly,
so--

77
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,280
OK, so... you'll live longer.

78
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
Yeah, but why?

79
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,480
What do you mean, "Why?" So you can do
more of the things that you enjoy.

80
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,200
I enjoy a drink.

81
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,160
-Right.
-All drunks hurt themselves.

82
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,960
Just the trick is to be a good drunk
and not hurt other people, but--

83
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,560
But that, though, Tony,
you calling yourself a drunk...

84
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,480
Only half the time. But, you know,
whatever... you want to label it,

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,320
I drink in times of trouble.

86
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
It's not my fault
the world's full of trouble, is it?

87
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,360
It's... it's an 'orrible place.

88
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,000
Everyone's screwed up in some way.
This is mine.

89
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,880
Everyone's got worries, like...

90
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,640
I dunno, money, or health, or famine, war.

91
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,640
We're chimps
with brains the size of planets.

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,280
No wonder we fucking get drunk
and try and kill each other. It's mental.

93
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,840
Always good to talk.

94
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,680
-Hiya.
-[Matt] Hey.

95
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,160
-[Tony] All right?
-Having a chat?

96
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,560
-[Tony] Yeah.
-Yeah.

97
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,320
[Tony] I was just explaining
my new plan is to drink myself to death

98
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,280
until I eventually implode in
on my own evolution.

99
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
Do you believe in all that?

100
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,240
Wh... what, the proven fact
that is evolution? Yeah.

101
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,920
That's just the problem, isn't it?
Your science only deals with facts.

102
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,920
-I'm a more open-minded type.
-[Tony] Good.

103
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
-Love anything paranormal.
-[Tony] Do ya?

104
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,880
Mm. Past lives. Telepathy.

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,160
Got a little bit of that myself, actually.

106
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,440
-Have ya?
-Mm.

107
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,120
Do you know how you know
when an angel's entered the room?

108
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,560
-So--
-Sorry,

109
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,720
are you going to carry on talking to me?

110
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,400
A sort of cinnamony smell.

111
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,800
[exaggerated groaning, retching]

112
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,360
-Childish.
-[Tony] Hold on.

113
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,680
Has an angel just entered the room?

114
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,240
Oh, no, you're eating a bun.

115
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,960
[Sandra chuckles]

116
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
So...

117
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,400
me being zen

118
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,000
didn't completely work out.

119
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,000
-No?
-No.

120
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,880
I went along
to the meditation thing, um...

121
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,120
but the guy was so annoying!

122
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,120
I ended up shouting at him
and storming out. [chuckles]

123
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,840
-How was he annoying?
-In every way.

124
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,080
Just slurping and sniffing.

125
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,960
-Oh, and doing that thing.
-What?

126
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,200
-[snorts]
-Oh!

127
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,680
-Exactly!
-Ah...

128
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,360
What did you shout?

129
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,760
I think I called him
"a snot-curdling cunt."

130
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,840
-[chuckling]
-Yeah.

131
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,760
Oh, dear.

132
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,240
I went home, got drunk,

133
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,600
and watched videos of Lisa.

134
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Do you know the fable
of the frog and the scorpion?

135
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,480
No.

136
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,200
Well, this scorpion wants
to get across the river.

137
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,800
So he asks the frog
if he'll give him a lift

138
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,480
on his back,
and the frog says, "No. You'd sting me."

139
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,160
And the scorpion says, "Why would
I do that? Then we'd both drown."

140
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,000
And so the frog said,
"Oh, yes, that's true. OK."

141
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,000
So halfway across the river,
the scorpion stings the frog.

142
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,440
And the frog says,

143
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,040
"Now we're both going to die.
Why did you sting me?"

144
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,840
And the scorpion says,

145
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,160
"Because I'm a scorpion."

146
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,840
Mm-hmm.

147
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,640
Yeah...

148
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,760
Yeah, I guess I can't change my nature.

149
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,920
No, you're the frog.

150
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,840
-The frog?
-Yes.

151
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
Really? Why?

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,520
Well, you knew you wouldn't enjoy
that meditation thing

153
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,560
but you went anyway
to please someone else.

154
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,520
And then you got angry,

155
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,480
and you even feel bad about that.

156
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,800
You're the frog.

157
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,360
Right.

158
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,600
Sensitive.

159
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
And trusting.

160
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,600
Nothing to do with the shape?

161
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,880
-[Anne chuckles lightly]
-Or the throat?

162
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
Oh... the frog?

163
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,440
[Anne chuckles]

164
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,360
-I was hoping I was the scorpion.
-Yeah, I thought you would.

165
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
-Know what I mean?
-Yes.

166
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
Only 'cause it's cooler. I love frogs.

167
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,920
But what I mean is
no one ever says, "Oh, I'd like a man.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,320
I'd like him to be
sort of podgy and sticky."

169
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
-Fair.
-[Anne laughs]

170
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,560
"I'd like him to be able
to hang onto a leaf."

171
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,400
-[both laugh]
-"I'd like my man to be able

172
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,160
to shove a worm into his mouth
with his front feet."

173
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,760
Everyone? Yeah, this is June's son, James.

174
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,920
-Your son now, innit?
-No, he's not.

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Um, he's starting work experience today.

176
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,960
-[James] Hi, everyone.
-Hey.

177
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,680
Be good. Do what you're told.
Come here. Don't be too annoying.

178
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
[June] Look at this.

179
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,560
-Give us a kiss.
-Bloody hell, Mum!

180
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,560
-Right, see you later.
-See you later.

181
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,520
-Come on, you.
-OK. Bye.

182
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,720
[June sighs]

183
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,920
Probably get on your nerves.
Got a good heart, though.

184
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,240
-OK.
-Well, not literally.

185
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,160
He's obese,
so all his insides are pretty bad.

186
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,200
Tragedy waiting to happen.
Well, he's got a terrible diet.

187
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,480
He's not had a poo for a week.

188
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
It's typical, that, though.

189
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,200
When he does go,
you can hear him all over the house,

190
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,560
in agony, screaming.

191
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,200
I say, "It's your own fault,
eat some bloody fruit!" But he won't.

192
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,080
I think that's how he'll die.

193
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,280
On the loo.
You know, like, straining, heart attack,

194
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,560
stroke, or something.

195
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,680
Like Elvis.

196
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,120
But without all the exciting stuff
Elvis did beforehand, you know?

197
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,360
Mm-hmm.

198
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,400
See you later.

199
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,800
[Lenny] All right. You probably should
start reading the paper.

200
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,600
-Why?
-Well, you're working here.

201
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,120
-I guess.
-James?

202
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,800
-Hi. Matt Braden, I'm the editor.
-Hi.

203
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,960
-Hi, Matt. Nice to meet you.
-You too.

204
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,240
This lot'll show you how it all works,
but if you've got any questions, just--

205
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
-Yeah, are we covering the am-dram?
-The...?

206
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,520
-What's that?
-I'm part of an amateur dramatics society,

207
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,160
we rehearse at the community hall.

208
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,440
It's brilliant, you know.
We do acting classes, dance.

209
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,600
You dance, do you?

210
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,160
Yeah, big time.

211
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,840
Dance, sing,

212
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,720
act, juggle...
I'm an all-round package, you know?

213
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Mm.

214
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Why don't you go and make some teas
for everyone?

215
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,760
-It's a good place to start, innit?
-OK. Um...

216
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,880
-Who wants tea?
-Nah.

217
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,240
I'm all right, thank you.

218
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,680
-No one wants tea.
-I'll have a tea.

219
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,280
-Oh, OK.
-Over there.

220
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
[James] Sure.

221
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,760
[Lenny sighs]

222
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,320
-You seem happy having a family.
-Yeah.

223
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
It's about time I settled down.

224
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,680
With one woman! [chuckles]

225
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,280
Was you a bit of a ladies' man?

226
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,240
[Lenny] Big time, yeah. Oh, yeah.

227
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,560
-Right.
-[Lenny] Yeah.

228
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,080
See, I was a late starter,
so I had a lot of catching up to do.

229
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,920
You know, I didn't really start
playing the field till my 20s.

230
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,400
Oh. OK.

231
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,160
Yeah, I was quite shy in my teens.
I wasn't always this cool, I guess.

232
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,240
-No?
-No. I...

233
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,440
-I used to be sort of odd-looking.
-[Tony] Fuck me!

234
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,600
-What did you used to look like?
-[Lenny] I dunno,

235
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,920
but I remember <i>The Ugly Duckling</i>
being quite inspirational.

236
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,600
Is that the one
where there's a weird little duckling

237
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,240
and all the other ducks
are taking the piss out of it,

238
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,760
but then when it grows up, it's not a duck
at all, it's, like, a big...

239
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,680
200-pound sort of human slug

240
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
that works in a local free newspaper?

241
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
-Yeah, that's the one.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

242
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,680
Play the field... Fuckin' hell!

243
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,920
Um... I'd like to cover the am-dram,
if that's all right?

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,480
-Yeah. We should all go and have a look.
-[James] Ooh...

245
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,200
-bis-quits!
-[Tony] Definitely.

246
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,080
Bloody hell, I'm knackered.

247
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,040
-[Brian] All right?
-[Tony] All right.

248
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,280
Whoa, who's this?

249
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,920
Hi, I'm James.

250
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,480
-You should help Brian with the papers.
-That's not really my thing.

251
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,280
Well, you're meant to do
a bit of everything.

252
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,120
-Bloody hell, all right, Dad!
-No, I'm not.

253
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,520
Hey! Come on. I could do with a hand.
My back's killing me.

254
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,680
All right,
but I've got to be at rehearsals by five.

255
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,800
-[Brian] Rehearsals for what?
-My am-dram group.

256
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,360
Can I join?

257
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,200
Yeah.
Anyone can join if they have the talent.

258
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,360
Bingo!

259
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,280
-[James] Oh.
-Ha.

260
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,680
-What do you do?
-[Brian] What don't I do?

261
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,480
I'm a puppeteer.

262
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,120
-[James] Oh.
-I... I write jokes.

263
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
[giggles]

264
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Check this out...

265
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
All right, Valerie?

266
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,000
Yep.

267
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,400
What's gray and comes in pints?

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,680
-Dunno.
-Elephant.

269
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,120
[Brian laughs wheezily]

270
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,200
[makes air hissing, splattering sound]
You're soaked!

271
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,320
-You're disgusting!
-[Brian] Oh, really?

272
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,800
I'm not the one
with a face full of jizz, love!

273
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,240
Right, afternoon, Tambury Players.

274
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,000
-Afternoon, Ken.
-[Ken] Everybody!

275
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,520
-[all] Afternoon, Ken.
-[Ken] Hello. How are we all doing?

276
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,800
-We all good?
-[June] Not bad.

277
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,720
Right, Brian,
welcome to the Tambury Players.

278
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,280
-Hi, Brian.
-Hi, Brian.

279
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Let's do a name game.

280
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,720
It's what we like to do,
don't we, when we get a new Player?

281
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,760
So, name, age,
and something that you don't like,

282
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,760
something that gets your goat,
something that winds you up.

283
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,680
-Uh... My name's Brian, and I'm 45.
-[Ken] Mm.

284
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,280
-Oh.
-And I really don't like my ex-wife.

285
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,880
-Oh, dear.
-At all.

286
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,160
Right. Why's that?

287
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,200
-Slut.
-[Ken] OK.

288
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,920
[Ken] Right, come on. Best faces on.

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,440
-Oh, hello. Are you from <i>The Gazette?</i>
-[Tony] Yep.

290
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,160
Ah! I run the society, Tambury Players.
Ken Otley, might've heard of me?

291
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
-[Tony] No.
-No?

292
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,920
No? I'm involved
in showbiz professionally.

293
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,840
-OK.
-I just run this for a bit of fun.

294
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,080
We do a couple of performances every year.
We've got one in a week or so, actually.

295
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,080
It's a revue show. Uh...

296
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
<i>A Night of a 1000 Stars.</i>

297
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,040
-And it's this lot, is it?
-It's these guys, yeah.

298
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,440
Everyone's doing their own thing,
you know, so no arguments.

299
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,880
-[Brian] Free expression!
-[Ken] This is Brian, new face.

300
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,720
-Do you know him?
-[Tony] Yeah, we know Brian.

301
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm gonna do stand-up, mate.

302
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,640
-Yeah.
-And I'm doing feminist poetry.

303
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,120
I'm doing <i>Send in the Clowns</i>
with interpretive dance.

304
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,040
Anyway, enough talk.
Come on, let's show them what we do.

305
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,040
-On your feet. Get rid of these chairs.
-Yes, it's me!

306
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,000
Hi. I'm sorry about that night,
I wasn't... I wasn't myself.

307
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,720
Oh, shame. I really enjoyed it.

308
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,120
It was nice to meet someone
as cantankerous as me.

309
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,440
-Mm.
-What on earth

310
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,360
are you covering this shitshow for?

311
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,960
I only started coming

312
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,240
to get out of the house
when my dead husband was home.

313
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,960
I mean, they're twats, but
it was preferable than being around him.

314
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,880
[Tony] Sure.

315
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,400
It's like <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.</i>
I feel like Nurse Ratched.

316
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,600
-See that little fat one?
-Mm.

317
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,360
Oh, I'd love to electrocute him.

318
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,880
-[James] Hello, Brian!
-[Ken] OK, and big people.

319
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,120
-Ken.
-[Ken] Big. Really big.

320
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,400
Come on, in we go, Rebecca.
Jumping up and down a little bit.

321
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,440
Just a little jump,
don't do yourself any mischief.

322
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,600
I can't help it, I just really miss her.

323
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,760
She having it off with anyone else?

324
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,520
-No.
-You?

325
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,520
No, of course I'm not.

326
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,520
There was someone at work
who did say that she liked me, but...

327
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,520
I'm not interested,
and I'm just so fed up at the moment.

328
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,040
Fuck's sake,
we all get fed up and depressed, mate.

329
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,520
Yeah, sorry, I don't mean to...

330
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,880
I mean, what do you do
when you get depressed?

331
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,920
I get twatted with Ratty and the Nonce.

332
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,760
-Right.
-Go to the football. Start a fight.

333
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,600
I hate all this namby-pamby nonsense,
you know?

334
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,640
This bleeding hearts...

335
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,560
[mockingly] "Oh, toxic masculinity,

336
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,120
it's OK to cry!"

337
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,640
It's also OK to have five pints,
drop an E,

338
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,560
and do some fucking trollop from behind
against the bins.

339
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,920
Whatever floats your boat, boy.

340
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,680
I think I've broke my thumb
up some bird's arse.

341
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,840
[Ken] You should come to me
if you want a good story.

342
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,400
I've had a life, let me tell you.
I've had a life.

343
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,520
Your readers'll wanna hear this,
write this down.

344
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,680
Um... I did go to drama school,
so I still act professionally,

345
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,800
but, you know, it's tough
to get the parts these days

346
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,840
if you're white, no offense, you know.

347
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,160
Taught drama at sixth form college
for a while,

348
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,440
do you know it? Full of liars.

349
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,640
Seriously, don't go there.
It's a nest of vipers.

350
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,320
Erm, I'm a talent agent by profession,
25 years in the business.

351
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,920
I've had 'em all through my books,

352
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,800
on the way up, on the way down,
and everything in between.

353
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,280
I could tell you some stories
about the showbiz world

354
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,960
that would make your hair curl.

355
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,720
-Like what?
-[Ken] Bloody hell, where do we start?

356
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,960
Hey, you know what you should do?
Ghostwrite a gossip column for me.

357
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,920
-Right.
-[Ken] This is gonna work. Right!

358
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,080
Come on. Let's do this.

359
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,120
-Grab a chair.
-Yeah.

360
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,320
[Ken] Come on, let's make it happen,
for God's sake!

361
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,640
[Matt] Oh, right.

362
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,880
[bottles clinking]

363
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,000
[sighs]

364
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,000
The thing is, mate,
you've got to take these opportunities

365
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,240
when they offer themselves to you,
you know?

366
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,200
Like that bird at work.

367
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,440
-Yeah.
-Get it while you're young.

368
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,480
[Matt] Oh...

369
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,120
Last week, right, we were, um...

370
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,360
we're pissed up
in Tamburgers in town, yeah?

371
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,480
And this waitress comes over
with the food. Fit.

372
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,280
And she goes, um,

373
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,240
"Is there anything else
I can do for you, gentlemen?"

374
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,120
And it was like, "Ding!"

375
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,800
Five minutes later, me and Ratty
are spitroasting her in the disabled bogs.

376
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,120
Yeah.

377
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,360
I'm banging away from behind, right?

378
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,520
Suddenly,
she takes Ratty's cock out her gob,

379
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,280
turns around to me and goes,
"Do you want fries with that?"

380
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,120
What a star!

381
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,960
Anyway, we come out, and there's this...

382
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,000
gammy little geezer in a wheelchair,

383
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,680
furious 'cause he's had to wait so long.

384
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,080
Yeah. Tuts at me.

385
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,960
So, I lean into him, I go,

386
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,880
"Hope you have as much fun in there
as we just did, you little cunt."

387
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
[clicks tongue]

388
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,000
[awkwardly] Yeah.

389
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,240
-Well, this has all been very helpful.
-Cheers.

390
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,160
Yeah.

391
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,360
Right, I've got a story for you.
Listen to this one.

392
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,640
I once had sex with a spirit.

393
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,960
I tell you what,
it weren't consensual either. Oh!

394
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,280
The plot thickens!

395
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,280
PSA.

396
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,440
Paranormal sexual assault,
it happens, OK?

397
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,920
Now, I like to sleep stark bollock naked
on me front, right?

398
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,480
That's my choice.

399
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,440
But some would say
that makes it my fault,

400
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,800
but that's just victim-blaming, in't it?
Nobody expects that.

401
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,840
I tell you something else as well,
I know who done it.

402
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,000
I was bummed...

403
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,320
by the ghost of Liberace.

404
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,840
That's the headline.

405
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,720
Made it easy for the bugger.

406
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,480
Why do you think he chose you?

407
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,560
Well, I might not be the only one!

408
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,760
When this gets out,
probably others will come forward.

409
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,800
That's how it usually happens, in't it?

410
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,240
Good. Well... Yeah...

411
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,800
I think we'll leave you
in the capable hands of...

412
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,800
-Sandy. So, yeah, tell her everything.
-[Ken] Great. I will.

413
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,960
OK? Good.

414
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,640
-Cheers.
-[Lenny] Bye.

415
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,920
-Bye.
-[Tony] All right.

416
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,080
[Ken] Now, Sandy.
Liz Taylor, you remember her?

417
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,400
Friend of a friend of mine worked
on her autopsy, right?

418
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,360
They found out
she was absolutely crammed with love eggs.

419
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,680
-[nurse chuckles]
-I want to know.

420
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,600
-You feel how soft they were?
-Yeah, very soft.

421
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,120
Yeah, we use a bit of softener on them,
no expenses spared here.

422
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,360
-You do them yourself?
-No.

423
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Well, I put them in the washing machine,
I don't manually scrub the towels.

424
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,680
[dejectedly] Hi, Dad.

425
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,520
This was Mum's.

426
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,920
She used to read this to me.

427
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,360
Poems.

428
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,560
You didn't care for it much.
Nor did I. I just liked her reading to me.

429
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,280
"Whose woods these are
I think I know

430
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,840
His house is in the village, though

431
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
He will not see me stopping here

432
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,760
-To watch--"
-"To watch his woods...

433
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,200
Fill up with snow."

434
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
-[nurse] Hi.
-Hi.

435
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,560
I saw you chatting with Simon,
I didn't want to disturb you.

436
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,280
Yes, I was chatting with Simon,
but, I mean, well...

437
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,200
we're not an item, are we?

438
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,240
[scoffs]

439
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,600
-That was quick.
-No.

440
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,000
Nothing quick about it.
[incredulous chuckle]

441
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,120
Sorry I'm such a flake.

442
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
It's OK.

443
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,000
You were right,
I'm not quite ready yet, but...

444
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,880
I'm... getting better, slowly.

445
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Well, that's good.

446
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,000
[Tony] Well, it is, yeah.
I'm trying to be a better person.

447
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,680
From where I was to, you know,

448
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,320
nearly fucking killing myself.

449
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,160
If it wasn't for the dog, I'd be dead.
So, little improvements.

450
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,720
Oh, well, that's great. Thanks for that.

451
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,680
You know, the dog is the only good thing
in your life.

452
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
[Tony] Fuckin' hell.

453
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,520
I didn't say that, did I?

454
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,760
You saw what I was like, I was an arsehole
to everyone in the world.

455
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,160
I hated everyone. Do you know why?

456
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,440
'Cause they didn't die of cancer
like Lisa.

457
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,760
Including me.
I hated me, 'cause I didn't die.

458
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,800
And I'd swap places with her tomorrow.

459
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,040
Sorry.

460
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,480
[mournful music plays]

461
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,920
Lisa's got cancer?

462
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,240
No. Not anymore.

463
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,840
Oh, good. [relieved sigh]

464
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,760
Because I love that girl.

465
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,760
Apple of my eye.

466
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,160
Couldn't stand anything to happen to her.

467
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,880
Yep.

468
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,280
Bon appétit.

469
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,760
Oh, wow!

470
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
I'm starving.

471
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,960
Wow!

472
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Is it hot?

473
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,040
[giggles, sniffs]

474
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
That is fucking rank!

475
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,880
-Is it?
-[Roxy giggles]

476
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,800
Lisa used to pretend it tasted good.

477
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,400
Yeah, but Lisa loved you! [laughs]

478
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,240
She did.

479
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,560
-Oh, no. I didn't--
-No, you're exactly right.

480
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,680
She lied to encourage good behavior.
At least I'd tried, you know.

481
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,640
Women are better than men.

482
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,120
And they never stop trying
to bring us up to their standard.

483
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,360
I mean... you're the only man
who's ever cooked me a meal.

484
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,680
So, technically, that's the best meal
a man has ever cooked you.

485
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,640
-So...
-[chuckles]

486
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,600
How bad is it?

487
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Put it this way,

488
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,160
it's the worst thing
I've had in my mouth today.

489
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,480
-And it's been busy. [laughs]
-Good.

490
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,080
Yeah.

491
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,440
I was and always will be useless
without her.

492
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,240
You're not... Don't say it.
You're not useless.

493
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,760
It's not that I couldn't do anything
without her, it's that I didn't want to.

494
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,880
It was no fun.

495
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
I'd come home,

496
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,720
she'd be in the kitchen... cooking,
like, chopping stuff,

497
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,000
feeding the dog, asking me about my day,

498
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,480
giving me advice on stuff, right?
And if she went, "Oh, pass the salt,"

499
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,760
I'd go, "Fuck me,
do I have to do everything around here?"

500
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,240
-[Roxy laughs]
-[Tony chuckles sadly]

501
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,280
[voice breaking] I miss her so much.

502
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,160
[sad music plays]

503
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,080
Have you ever thought
of having a real relationship?

504
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,200
You know, I want what you had.

505
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,920
-Marriage and--
-So...

506
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
this brings me to my next point.

507
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,120
I know a guy who's really into you...

508
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,400
and he'd like to meet up.

509
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,920
Do you like a man in uniform?

510
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
[surprised gasp]

511
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,120
-Not a copper?
-No.

512
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,600
Soldier?

513
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,560
Postman.

514
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,160
-What's wrong with him?
-Honestly, I don't know where to start.

515
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,720
-Fucking hell!
-No.

516
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,920
He asked me to downplay him.

517
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,720
-Modest.
-Not really.

518
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,760
-No, um...
-OK.

519
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,200
-What does he look like?
-Uh...

520
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,640
Sort of... beard.

521
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,080
Like a hipster?

522
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,120
Well, more like
what the hipsters base their look on.

523
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,480
-Hippie?
-Homeless.

524
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,480
-Nothing wrong with the homeless.
-You're so woke.

525
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,720
So?

526
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,960
Come on, then. Well?

527
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
OK. Yeah.

528
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,680
Just tell him, you know...
tell him all about me

529
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,800
-and stuff so there's no weirdness.
-OK.

530
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,800
-Great.
-Great.

531
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,200
He'll be over the moon.

532
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,440
Brilliant.

533
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,360
I'm gonna have to go
'cause I actually need to eat... [laughs]

534
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,760
...before I go to work.

535
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,720
No, that's fair enough. That's fine.

536
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,720
-I'm so sorry!
-Good. No.

537
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,000
You can let yourself out
'cause I need to eat the meal I cooked us.

538
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,920
-I'm sorry. Thank you.
-It's all right.

539
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,200
-[Tony] See you later.
-See you later, lovely.

540
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,600
-I'll tell the postman.
-[Roxy laughs]

541
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,200
-See you later.
-See you later.

542
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,120
[bed squeaks rhythmically]

543
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,160
Mum, have you seen my juggling balls?

544
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,760
Oh... They're probably
where you left them, lovey.

545
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,920
I just thought you might have
put them down somewhere.

546
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,760
Um... I saw 'em in the kitchen earlier.

547
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,880
Yeah. I was practicing in there.

548
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,600
Oh, well done. Night night, darling.

549
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,640

551
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,640
Night, Lenny.

552
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,080
Can I call you Dad?

553
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,840
-Not at the moment.
-All right. Night night.

554
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,840
Night night.

555
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,000
