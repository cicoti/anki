00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,400
-Sorry to hear about your dad.
-Cheers.

176
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
What are these?

177
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,320
Sleeping pills.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,840
Why?

179
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
To help me sleep.

180
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,840
Really?

181
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Yeah, I just...

182
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,960
[exhales nervously]
Why are they down here?

183
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,240
So I don't have to get up to kill myself.

184
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,400
Tony, seriously--

185
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,920
What? There...
Look, there was a time, but, you know...

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,160
I mean, you could take 'em away,
but if I really wanted to do summat,

187
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,600
there's knives in the kitchen,

188
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,120
I could fucking hang myself
in a wardrobe with a belt.

189
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,120
-Why you still thinking like that?
-I'm not, particularly.

190
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,720
Not all the time.

191
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,440
Have you just come round to nag me?

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No, I've come...

193
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,560
I've come round to see if you're OK.

194
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,280
How's it going with the postman?

195
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,960
Please tell me you're OK.

196
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
I'm OK.

197
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,400
How's it going with the postman?

198
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,680
Yeah, I mean... he's a funny man.

199
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,360
Nice description.

200
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,840
I'm just worried, you know,
my past is going to catch up with me

201
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,560
and he's not gonna be able
to cope with it.

202
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,800
Don't worry about your past.
Worry about your future.

203
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,960
I'm more worried about your future.

204
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,440
You remind me of Lisa sometimes.

205
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,320
Everyone else had to be OK
before she could be OK.

206
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,640
[sentimental piano music plays]

207
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,360
At night, in bed,

208
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
she'd say,

209
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,320
"Good night."

210
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,600
And sometimes,
I wouldn't answer her, to wind her up.

211
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,440
And she'd go, "Say it!
You gotta say it, or I can't sleep."

212
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,840
And I'd go, "Why? It's stupid."
She'd go, "Say it!"

213
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,640
And I had to say it last as well.

214
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,320
And, uh, eventually, I'd go...

215
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,520
"Oh, good night."

216
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,320
Then she could sleep.

217
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,840
[Tony taps keyboard]

218
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Do you want a tea?

219
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,360
Uh... No, I'm fine, thanks.

220
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,800
Bloody hell, who died? [chuckles]

221
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,040
Tony's dad died, um, last night.

222
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,360
Oh, no.

223
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,040
-Oh, no.
-No, but don't, um...

224
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, I'm so sorry about your dad. Oh!

225
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,520
She didn't get the memo.

226
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,760
Cheers, Kath.

227
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,400
He had a good innings, as they say.

228
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,640
Er... Carry on, everyone.

229
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
[Lenny] A job's come in,

230
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,600
but I can cover it on my own,
you don't need to worry.

231
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
I'm fine.

232
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,960
Look, everyone, I'm fine.

233
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,520
I lost him a couple of years ago,
to be honest, so...

234
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,920
got me used to the idea.

235
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,080
Um...

236
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,320
It's not like Lisa,
it's the natural order of things.

237
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,760
Um...

238
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,600
I'll still miss him, obviously,

239
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,240
more than if it had been sudden,
in a way. Um...

240
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,480
Once he got ill, I saw him every day.
[chuckles sadly]

241
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,880
Before he was ill,
I saw him about once a month.

242
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,800
Life goes on. So...

243
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
back to normal.

244
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,960
Yeah.

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,080
You look sad.

246
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,720
Good work.

247
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,320
-What's the story?
-[Lenny] Um...

248
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,920
"Fifty-year-old man identifies
as eight-year-old schoolgirl."

249
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,040
Now we're talking!

250
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760

[Tony] <i>Er...</i>

252
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
<i>And, Tracy,</i>

253
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,560
what do you... make of all this?

254
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,080
-Well, it's bloody ridiculous.
-It's not.

255
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,280
It is, it's embarrassing.
It's a load of bollocks.

256
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,120
I'm trans, deal with it.

257
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,880
You're not trans,
you're having a breakdown.

258
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,840
Transphobic.

259
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,720
-It's not transphobic, you're not trans.
-I am trans.

260
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,560
I haven't got a problem with trans people.
<i>Real </i>trans people.

261
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,880
I couldn't give a shit what gender
people want to be, or become,

262
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,120
or what they want to be called,
how they want to dress,

263
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,240
or if they keep the knob
or fanny they were born with,

264
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,600
I couldn't give a shit.

265
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,480
But you are not trans,
you're having a fucking breakdown.

266
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,760
-I identify... as an eight-year-old girl.
-Well, you're not an eight-year-old girl.

267
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,040
You are what you identify as.

268
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,880
He pulls this sort of shit all the time.

269
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,720
He saw a documentary once about ME,
had that for a year.

270
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,200
That was a nightmare! You're tired
all the time. I couldn't work.

271
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
It was bullshit.

272
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,360
There is a lot of misunderstanding
and cynicism about the disease.

273
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,640
Yeah, and you didn't fucking have it,
you moron.

274
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,040
Silly twat thought
he caught Down syndrome last year.

275
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,880
I was seven!

276
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,320
Oh, fuck me!

277
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,560
You're a 50-year-old plumber
from Sheffield.

278
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,400
Your name's Dennis, for fuck's sake.

279
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,600
-It's Denise.
-I am not calling you Denise.

280
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,880
Again, transphobic, you see.
If you loved me, you'd deal with it.

281
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,480
Well, I do love you.
But I married Dennis Charlton.

282
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,680
And if that's no longer your name,
then I'm not married to you.

283
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,760
Right. Once and for all...

284
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,240
I identify as an eight-year-old girl
called Denise.

285
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,920
Therefore, I am an eight-year-old girl.

286
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,800
Well, tell that to your cock and bollocks,
you silly cunt.

287
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,840
Everyone knows what's in your knickers,
and if you're an eight-year-old girl,

288
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,160
you've been shoplifting
from the local fucking butchers.

-What's going on?
-Ay-up, love.

291
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,640
It's the local paper.
They're going to do a bit on us.

292
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,160
Dad! [sighs]

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,920
-Do you want to play dollies later?

Take a picture.

296
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,240
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

297
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,480
[camera clicks]

298
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,720
Is that going to be in the paper?

299
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,000
Er... Yeah, I guess so.

300
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,560
Oh, I want to kill myself!

301
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,200
[Tony] No, you don't.
We don't have to mention you.

302
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
He's still your dad.

303
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,200
How can he be my dad
if he's an eight-year-old girl now?

304
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,160
We both know
he's not an eight-year-old girl.

305
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,000
He's... your dad,

306
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,200
and you'll miss him when he's not around.

307
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,040
-My dad died yesterday.
-Really?

308
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,920
Yeah. I miss him.

309
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,680
And I'm old.

310
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,320
-You love him, don't you?
-Yeah.

311
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,040
[Tony] Course you do, he's your dad.

312
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,000
You might have to remind him of that
now and again, but...

313
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,840
one day, you'll both laugh about this.

314
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,800
-When?
-[Tony] Dunno.

315
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
When he's 12?

316
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,480
[Tony and girl chuckle]

317
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,960
[Tony] I'll see you later.

318
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Poor kid.

319
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,280
Wife weren't that happy.

320
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,560
I know, he's having a breakdown, in't he?

321
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,840
-You think?
-What do you mean?

322
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,960
Well, you don't believe he's just trans?

323
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,040
I dunno. As I say, I'm old.

324
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,840
-He could be trans <i>and </i>having a breakdown.
-Yeah. Anything's possible these days.

325
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,120
-Do you still get transvestites?
-What do you mean?

326
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,000
Well... now, people are transgender,
ain't they, or gender fluid?

327
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,400
So, a bloke can say,
"I identify as a bloke or a woman,"

328
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,920
and that's their gender,
whatever they say it is.

329
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,960
-Right.
-Well, years ago,

330
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,680
you used to have transsexuals,

331
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,480
where you'd have an operation
to become a proper bird.

332
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,560
And you had transvestites,

333
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,800
you know, blokes that liked
to dress up as a bird now and again.

334
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,840
You don't really see them ones anymore.

335
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,720
But they were like that fella.

336
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,760
They didn't do all of the,
"I identify as a real woman," or anything.

337
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,120
Then you had, like,
young people being a bit androgynous,

338
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,240
wearing makeup for fashion,
and they'd grow out of it an' that.

339
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,480
-What's your point?
-Well, it's all got a bit serious.

340
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,160
No one just dresses up as a bird
for a laugh anymore.

341
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,000
Good. It was never that funny.

342
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,200
