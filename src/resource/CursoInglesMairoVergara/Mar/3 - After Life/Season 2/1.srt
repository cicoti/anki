174
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,200
a bit of... Don't shake your head,
you haven't heard what it is yet.

175
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,960
-Yoga, a bit of philosophy...
-Mm.

176
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,720
-...which you like, don't you?
-Yeah.

177
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,040
Right. So, what do you think?

178
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
-Don't just--
-No.

179
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,560
Come on, please?

180
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm having a shit time as well, OK?

181
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,840
I'm alone. I'm sleeping on a floor.

182
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
[Tony] That's zen.

183
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,320
-Uh...
-Like Mr. Miyagi. They love a floor.

184
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,640
"They"? You... [frustrated sigh]

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,880
Right.

186
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,080
-Please?
-Oh, for fuck's sake.

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,960
All right.

188
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,520
-Thank you.
-Is that it?

189
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,560
Yeah. Yes, that's...

190
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,920
-fine.
-Good.

191
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,680
Don't tell anyone about... Kath.

192
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,120
I'd already forgotten that.

193
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,240
-Perfect.
-All right?

194
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,960
-Yeah, good. I'm... Yeah.
-Good.

195
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,920
<i>Don't </i>tell anyone?

196
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,960
[sighs]

197
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,720
See, all respectable again.

198
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,440
-Had a bit of bed head in the back there.
-[Tony] Hiya.

199
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,280
-Hi.
-Hi, Dad.

200
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,440
[Tony sighs]

201
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,080
I, uh... just interviewed
a hundred-year-old woman.

202
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,440
-Oh, yeah?
-Funny.

203
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,760
And, uh...

204
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,160
Lenny asked me
how it was going with the nurse.

205
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,480
I said, uh... we're just friends 'cause...

206
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,360
you'd said I wasn't over... Lisa.

207
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,560
And did you say you agreed?

208
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
Yeah, course. Yeah.

209
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,000
What did he say?

210
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,480
He said I shouldn't wait around forever
or I'll miss the boat. [chuckles]

211
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,440
Mm...

212
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
[Tony] So...

213
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,480
Have you not told him my name?

214
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,960
What do you mean?

215
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,240
He said, "How's it going with <i>the nurse?"</i>

216
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,560
[Tony] Uh...

217
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,920
Yeah, I'm sure I have.
That wasn't really the point of the story.

218
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,760
-[grunts]
-Joe?

219
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,960
What?

220
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
You're Joe.

221
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Joe, your brother?

222
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,640
Hello, mate.

223
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,240
I do look a bit like him. I mean,
he's been dead ten years, but still...

224
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,960
What, Joe's dead?

225
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,120
[Tony sighs]

226
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,680
Oh, that's right, yeah. Joe's dead.
Yeah. Lovely fella.

227
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,600
So, you're Joe's boy?

228
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,680
I'm your boy, Dad.

229
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,000
Am I Joe?

230
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,120
Fuck me.

231
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,000
And just for the record, I didn't declare
that we would just be friends.

232
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,240
When I said
I didn't think you were over your wife,

233
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,680
I just thought it might, I don't know,
gee you up a bit to be ready.

234
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,080
Not just say, "Do you know what?

235
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
That's all right.
Let's just be friends, eh?"

236
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,040
Well, all I was doing was
agreeing with your observation

237
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,200
that I wasn't over Lisa--

238
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,480
Do you know what? It's fine.
Just don't worry about it.

239
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,680
-Right.
-[nurse] You know.

240
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,440
-All right, gorgeous?
-[nurse] Oh!

241
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,040
Hiya.

242
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,560
-[man] Where is she?
-[nurse ]She's in her room.

243
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,920
-All right. See you later, babe.
-[nurse chuckles]

244
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,440
Who's that?

245
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,200
Simon. He's the son
of one of the new residents.

246
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,120
Right.

247
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
He's nice.

248
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
He winked.

249
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,400
He said, "See you later, babe,"
and winked.

250
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,320
So?

251
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,120
So... [chuckles]

252
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,840
Right. Anyway...

253
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
I'd better get on.

254
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,400
See you later, babe.

255
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,080
[Tony] I feel... panicked

256
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,880
all the time.

257
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,080
Like... I'm going to do the wrong thing.

258
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,680
So... I don't do anything.

259
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,200
And that's why I think I'm going to
blow it with the nurse, but...

260
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,800
Concentrate on getting better.
She'll wait.

261
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,680
If you want her to.

262
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,520
I'm not sure I'm worth...

263
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,240
waiting for. I'm embarrassed...

264
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,760
that I ever acted the way I did.

265
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,040
Whatever gets you better.

266
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Yeah. I'm not better, but...

267
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,080
I'm not gonna stick my head
in the oven.

268
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,320
I doubt you know where the oven is.

269
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,120
-Good one!
-[Anne chuckles]

270
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,000
You were in pain.

271
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,240
Yeah, that's what
I'm embarrassed about, really.

272
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,680
Dying of cancer,

273
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,880
that's being in pain.

274
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Actual pain.

275
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,280
I felt a bit sorry for myself.

276
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
I still do.

277
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
But, uh...

278
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,520
I realized that...

279
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,320
death will come soon enough, so...

280
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,080
And there's nothing to fear about it
because...

281
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,080
you know, no feelings to worry about.

282
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,000
Not mine, anyway. Just...

283
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,520
you know, peace and quiet.

284
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,880
I am trying to work out if there's a way
I can still carry on annoying people,

285
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,440
after I die, but I haven't...

286
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,080
-[Anne laughs]
-I haven't cracked it yet.

287
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,160
So, I'm just gonna have to make the most
of that when I'm alive.

288
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,200
-It's a hobby.
-Yeah.

289
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,800
Exactly.

290
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,040
Just to arseholes, though. That's...

291
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,920
you know, I'm trying to be nice
to the people...

292
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,440
who are nice to me, at least.

293
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,000
I realized that everyone's struggling,

294
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,600
and, um, I feel
that I should help the people...

295
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,680
who helped me.

296
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,520
I'm actually going to a meditation...
yoga... thing tonight.

297
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
It's a favor...

298
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,840
for my brother-in-law, who...

299
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,240
is separated from his wife, and...

300
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,680
he could do with the company, so...

301
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,640
you know.

302
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,920
Lovely.

303
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,200
Mm.

304
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,080
[door opens]

305
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,520
Oh...

306
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,640
Coffee. I am gasping.

307
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,160
-Come in.
-[Roxy] What?

308
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,680
Nothing.

309
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,480
-What, me just letting myself in?
-Well,

310
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,800
some would've knocked.
I could've been naked.

311
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,720
Uh... I could see through the door
you weren't naked.

312
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,960
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

313
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,880
If I had have been naked, you'd look
through the door and see me naked.

314
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,640
Yeah, and I wouldn't have come in.

315
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,920
But you'd have seen me naked.

316
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,560
[chuckles] Wouldn't have bothered me.

317
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,680
That's all right, then.
What would you have done?

318
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,560
-What do you mean?
-You come to the door,

319
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,840
you see me naked, you don't come in,

320
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,800
what then?

321
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,360
I'd have knocked.

322
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,880
So, now, I'm here naked,

323
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,120
I hear a knock, I look up,
I see you looking through at me,

324
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,840
what do you do, fucking wave?

325
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,160
[chuckling] I don't know!

326
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,800
Maybe I wouldn't knock,
maybe I'd just sneak off.

327
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,080
Anyway...

328
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,280
why are you sat at a table naked
like some weird Monty Python sketch?

329
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,720
That's my business.

330
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,280
My house, my rules.

331
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,840
-Do you sit at the table naked, then?
-No.

332
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,680
I've got a dog.
I don't want her seeing that. [sniggers]

333
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,480
What do you miss about her, though?

334
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,080
Everything. You know, I...

335
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,000
I miss her liking me.

336
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,840
Um...

337
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,480
I hate to think
I've upset her in some way.

338
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Or that she just doesn't love me anymore.

339
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,040
Um...

340
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,840
Don't worry about it.

341
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,680
What do you mean?

342
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,480
Is that advice?

343
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,520
Yeah.

344
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,840
Just don't worry about it, mate.

345
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,600
Yeah... Just not that easy, though, is it?
[chuckles]

346
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,120
You know, it's like saying,
"Don't worry that you're bleeding."

347
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,480
You know, just by saying that,
it doesn't go away.

348
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,400
I was bleeding from the anus
for a month last year

349
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,920
and I never went to the doctor.

350
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,160
Right.

351
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,280
It just went away.

352
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,880
But, I mean,
you're the doctor in this, aren't you?

353
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,480
So are you saying
I shouldn't go to you?

354
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,160
No, of course not.
What I'm saying is you've got to ignore

355
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,600
worrying about her and start doing stuff.

356
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,720
[Matt] Yeah.

357
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,040
You should come out with me,
Ratty, and the Nonce.

358
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,720
-The Nonce?
-Real name Ian Trouton,

359
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,040
but we call him "the Nonce"
or "Pedo Ian."

360
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,720
I mean, he's not a real kiddy fiddler.
It's a... it's an in-joke.

361
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Oh. [chuckles]

362
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,800
He fucked a dwarf once
when he was off his head.

[laughs]

364
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,280
He said it was like fucking a child.

365
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,840
But legal. Although, should it be? Urgh.

366
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,040
Um... I would go to the doctor
about your anus, by the way.

367
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
Hiya. Could I just use your bathroom?

368
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,120

I'll lock up.

No, I've got to go out after,
so I thought I'd have a wash.

[Tony] Unbelievable!

-Why?
-It just is.

401
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,720
There's nothing weird

402
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,280
I need to see a potential flat share

Oh, this is typical.
I try and be more chilled.

406
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,200
The reason I'm in a hurry is
that I've got a meditation class tonight

407

to try and be more zen,

408
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,520
and then shit like this happens
to wind me the fuck up again.

Don't think the Dalai Lama'd be like that,
would he?

Let's see, shall we?
Go to his house tomorrow
