How long...
have you been posting your mail...

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,120
in a dog waste bin?

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,280
About a year now, I'd say.

19
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,080
Right. I mean, it says "dog waste" on it.

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,960
Yeah, but my eyes are shot to shit.

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,560
-Right.
-[man] I'm blind as a bat.

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,440
These aren't mine. I lost mine.
I found these on a bus.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,760
-They're no good.
-Right.

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,960
Gotta be near the house,
need a piss every ten minutes.

25
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,680
I got a prostate like a coconut.

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,560
This is the least of my worries,
to be honest with you, with all that.

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,120
Anyway, where was I?

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,320
So... Right, my sister, yeah?
She lives in Australia.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,840
I'm thinking,
"Why's she ignoring me?"

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,880
-You were writing to her, and she wasn't--
-Yeah.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,840
-But you were putting them in there?
-Well, yeah. I'm not on email, see.

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,800
I keep getting threatening letters
from the gas and the electricity.

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,360
I said, "Hey, I've paid,"
I said, "and I'll prove it to you."

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,800
So, I sent them another letter.

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,760
And I put it in here, with all my letters,
in all that shit!

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,680
What did you think the smell was?
Wasn't that a clue?

37
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,080
-I thought that was me.
-You thought it was you?

38
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,160
There's a similar smell in the house,
to be honest.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,640
-I've got nobody to be hygienic for.
-[Tony] No?

40
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,160
Nah. No point, is there?
No one to wash for.

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,600
-Yourself, maybe?
-No, no point, is there?

42
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,840
No point to anything, is there, really?
I don't know where they took the letters.

43
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,400
Where do they take dog shit?
They probably bury it, do they?

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
That's where we're all gonna end up,
though, innit?

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,400
You know, we're all just future shit,
you know? I've got no self-esteem, I have.

46
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,160
No.

47
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
That's why I never had a relationship.

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,360
You've never had a relationship?

49
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,800
'Cause I knew that if I did...

50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,440
that she's going to find somebody,
see, better than me.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Better than me, at that.
And then leave me, wouldn't she? Eh?

52
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,400
Right, come on, then. What's your angle
on this? What's it gonna be?

53
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,320
I don't think there is an angle.
You've been posting your letters in a...

54
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,040
a box of shit for a year.
That is pretty much it.

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,480
There's a moral to the story,
though, ain't there? Gotta be.

56
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,680
You know, be careful.
Careful now where you post your letters.

57
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,640
-Take a picture.
-Yeah.

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,400
-Hurry up. I need a piss.
-[Lenny] All right.

59
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,760
-Get on with it.
-[shutter clicks]

60
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,320
-Hang on. Got it?
-Great.

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,240
[man] All right.

62
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,080
-There he goes.
-Yep.

63
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,520
-[Tony] That's depressing.
-[Lenny] Yeah.

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,000
[Tony] Imagine never having a relationship
in case it ends.

65
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,320
A relationship <i>is </i>life.

66
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,720
Exactly.

67
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,600
I've had a good life.

68
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,360
-Well, it's still going!
-No, I know. I know.

69
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,720
Look, he's pissing where he stands.
Like a dog.

70
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,800
[Tony] That's the best he's felt all day,
that piss.

71
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,400
Right, I'm off to see my dad.

72
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,400
Right. I'm just gonna...

73
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,760
-See you later.
-See ya.

74
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,680
[shutter clicks]

75
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,040
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

76
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,360
-[nurse] You all right?
-Yeah. Um...

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,520
Is he OK? He seems a bit...

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,880
-Yeah. Well, he's been a bit up and down.
-[Tony grunts]

79
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,600
Perky this morning, though, eh?

80
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,040
Called Simon a cunt.

81
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,880
Did he?

82
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,160
[chuckles]
Yeah, I thought you'd like that.

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
That's my boy!

84
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,080
Anyway, I'd better get on.
I've got to--

85
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,120
Um, I'm going to that revue thing tonight,

86
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,360
-if you wanna...
-Oh!

87
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,480
-I'm working, sorry.
-Right. Yeah.

88
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,760
Well, it's no big deal.

89
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,240
If you want to chat,
give me a call... or text.

90
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,840
-[chuckles] OK.
-All right.

91
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
See you later.

92
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,880
Do you want to lie down, Dad?

93
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,360
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Come on, then.

94
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,040
[Tony's dad exhales heavily]

95
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,280
-Come on.
-Yeah.

96
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,200
[Tony's dad groans lightly]

97
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,920
And I know that nothing's...
you know, certain or anything, but...

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,560
Jill's gonna come with me
to the revue.

99
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,400
-What revue?
-It's a local theater thing.

100
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,120
Oh, yeah?

101
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,480
Plenty of thespussy knocking about, then?

102
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,640
No, I don't think so.

103
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,200
It's... more like...

104
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,680
um, local people doing some songs, and...

105
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,000
I mean, there's one woman
who does feminist poetry.

106
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,320
[scoffs] Feminists!

107
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,280
Lesbians make me laugh, you know.
They use dildos and stuff, don't they?

108
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,680
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

109
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,440
Sorry, do you like cock or don't you?
You're confusing me here, darling.

110
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,840
Make your fucking mind up.
D'you know what I mean?

111
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Yeah!

112
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,520
-Do you?
-Yeah. No, it's...

113
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,560
er... a good point.

114
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,440
I actually had to...
let down that chick at work.

115
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,760
She was coming on a bit strong.
I was like... "Nah.

116
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,360
Back... Back off, baby."

117
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
-Wise.
-Yeah.

118
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,960
-Don't shit on your own doorstep, brother.
-That's what I thought, yeah.

119
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,520
Anyway, she's in the bank
if you need a nosh.

120
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,640
[chuckles lightly] OK.

121
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,600
-Fancy seeing you here.
-[Anne laughs] 

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,520
-You OK?
-Yeah.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,960
Still covering awful local stories
that no one cares about,

124
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,840
upsetting people I like,

125
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,440
trying to keep my job,

126
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,440
and not kill anyone. You?

127
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,800
[laughs heartily]

128
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,080
Ah...

129
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,680
It's nice to hear you moan
about work, and...

130
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,720
relationships, just like a normal person.

131
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,360
-Yeah, I suppose this is progress.
-Mm.

132
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,600
I should pay you for these chats.

133
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,440
All that money I waste on the shrink,
this is much better.

134
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,120
Your friendship means more to me
than money.

135
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Are you lonely?

136
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,440
I only miss one person.

137
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,640
Yep. Me too.

138
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,160
-What?
-Um...

139
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
Do you want to go to the revue tonight?

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,480
I don't think so.
I don't get out much these days.

141
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,240
It's hardly out. It's less out than this!

142
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,560
And it's still just sitting down
looking at something.

143
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
It'll be funny.

144
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
Come on.

145
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,320
OK.

146
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,840
-Yeah?
-I'll pop in.

147
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,320
Brilliant.

148
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,320
[Paul] I'd very much like to thank you all
for letting me share your day.

149
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,880
Hi. Um... Would you like to go
to the revue thing tonight?

150
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
What is it?

151
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,000
Awful, probably.

152
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,680
But some of us are going down,
and someone I... um...

153
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,920
Just it might be fun.
I thought you might...

154
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,760
Uh, sure, yeah. Why not?

155
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,960
Great. It's at the community hall
at 7:30. 

156
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,080
But we'd get there early enough
for a drink if you want, or just...

157
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,640
Is there a dress code?
Should I wear a suit or...?

158
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,920
No. It's really not a posh do. [chuckles]

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,200
What would you wear
to visit a mental home?

160
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,240
But... you know, look nice.

161
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,120
-So--
-Look nice?

162
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,280
I mean... groomed, whatever.

163
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,200
Oh.

164
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,800
OK.

165
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,600
-Brilliant.
-Well, I'll see you later.

166
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,640
Good.

167
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,320
-Look.
-What are you doing?

168
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,600
-[James] Just limbering up.
-[Valerie] This is an office.

169
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,120
-[June] Hiya.
-Hi.

170
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,800
-What you doing?
-Just limbering up.

171
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,120
Come on, you.
Let's get you down that hall.

172
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,840
If your dad could see you now.

173
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,680
What happened? Is he dead?

174
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,960
No, he walked out on us.
James did his head in, didn't ya?

175
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,120
-[James] I was a bit of a handful.
-[June] Mm.

176
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,560
Thought there was something wrong
with him at first.

177
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,200
He even had to see the school doctor.

178
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,600
-Thought I was mad [chuckles].
-Or backward.

179
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,440
[James] Yeah, I was terrible at everything
at school.

180
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,440
I was more interested in, like,
entertaining people, you know?

181
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,240
-And there wasn't anything wrong with you?
-Oh, no. Not, like, mental or anything.

182
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Overweight and... hyperactive, but--

183
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
Just really annoying.

184
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,440
Mm. His dad said, "It's either him or me.

185
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,640
One of us has got to go
for this to work."

186
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,760
And you chose him?

187
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,480
Oh, no. I chose his dad at first.
But when we asked James to leave,

188
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,760
he broke down,
threatened to kill himself, didn't ya?

189
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,960
Yeah.

190
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,680
Found someone better now, anyway.

191
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
[June giggles]

192
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,600
Right, let's get going.

193
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,400
Yeah. Lots to do. I'm starving as well.

194
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,640
[June] No, don't be eating too much.
You always do that:

195
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,240
get excited, all churned up,
and then you've got to dance around--

196
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,040
If you're getting food, um,
I'll... I'll come with you.

197
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,280
[sniggers]

198
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,240
See ya.

199
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,440
[Lenny] Wait!

200
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,360
-Good.
-[Kath] I'd better get off an' all.

201
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,160
To, uh... get ready for tonight.

202
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,880
Got a date.

203
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,200
So...

204
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,000
-See ya later.
-Bye.

205
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
[Sandy] Bye.

206
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,600
Looking forward to tonight?

207
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,520
It's work, isn't it?

208
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,760
[Tony] Yeah, but...

209
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
might be fun.

210
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,760
[chuckles sadly] Yeah.

211
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,560
We laugh at James
for living with his mum,

212
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,440
but he's ten years younger than me,
I live with my mum.

213
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,600
Everyone's got a date.

214
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
I haven't.

215
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,960
-Sorry.
-No, I mean...

216
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,320
you're not the only one.
It's no big deal.

217
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,600
There's no rush.

218
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,480
Don't wallow. It's...

219
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,200
You get addicted to it.

220
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,640
I am, I think.

221
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Grief, I mean.

222
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,320
I sort of know where I am with it.
Do you know what I mean? I just...

223
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,960
When summat goes well or I see
a glimpse of hope, I get confused.

224
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,360
And then when it all turns to shit,
I go, "Oh, there it is.

225
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,440
Now we can get drunk and wait for death."
[chuckles]

226
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,840
When you do find a fella,

227
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,720
dance with him when he wants.

228
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,440
I wish I'd danced with Lisa
every time she asked.

229
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,320
It was 'cause I was embarrassed sometimes
or lazy.

230
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, what I'd give for...

231
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,440
just five minutes with her now.

232
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,920
Just holding her. Just moving around.

233
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,000
See?

234
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,400
-Back to normal. Both crying again.
-[Sandy chuckles]

235
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,080
-Good work.
-Yeah. [sighs]

236
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,560
You'll be fine.

237
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,400
-Really straight away.
-You gonna go again?

238
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,800
Well, I've hardly had any of this,
but I'd normally--

239
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,000
Hiya. My date.

240
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Short notice.

241
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,680
[chuckles] Businessman, though.
Got a Rolls Royce, haven't ya?

242
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,480
-Secondhand.
-Still a Rolls Royce. Very successful.

243
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,880
Yeah, I made a lot of money in scrap.

244
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,040
Don't say scrap.

245
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
-Let's go and see this.
-Yeah, let's...

246
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,040
-Oh! You're my postman.
-[Pat] Yeah.

247
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,960
-Are you the hoarder?
-Yeah!

248
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,080
-You're a prossie! I know you.
-[both] Sex worker.

249
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,600
Yeah, seen you at the garages.
I couldn't afford that.

250
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,800
-Not in a million years.
-No.

251
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,840
Have to make up my own fun.
I've shoved my cock up my arse.

252
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,720
-So, how does that work?
-Ooh! Now he's interested!

253
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,840
Trade secrets, innit?
Nah, you're a mate.

254
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,000
Basically, I cram it up there flaccid...

255
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,880
and then I wait for it to get hard.

256
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,800
It's the only way it can be done,
if I'm honest.

257
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,400
I think a bit too honest.
