1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,600
All right?

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,240
Yeah. You?

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,160
Yeah.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,040
Do you want some toa-- Oh.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,040
-So?
-[Tony] What?

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,440
Ask me about the date!

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,280
Oh, right. Good?

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,960
-Yeah. He's, uh... He's funny, isn't he?
-Definitely.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,880
Sort of... rough and...

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,480
rugged?

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,720
[sighs] Like he lives under a bridge.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,480
[doorbell rings]

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,960
-All right?
-[Tony] Yeah.

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,160
Is Roxy in there?

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,440
-Yeah, why?
-Well, I've just popped round to see her.

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,040
Surely you've popped round
to deliver my mail?

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,320
You haven't got any mail.
Can I come in, then?

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
It's like a zombie movie.

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,680
You're always just outside the house
trying to get in.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,120
[Pat] Don't be antisocial.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,080
-Can I have that last bit of toast?
-Yeah.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,560
Ah. Cheers, babe.

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,760
-Do you want something on it?
-No, you're all right.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,720
-Got any peanut butter?
-No.

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,440
-Don't worry about it, honestly.
-Sure? I'll pop out and...

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,560
-Honestly, don't worry.
-All right, good.

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
[doorbell rings]

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,160
Oh! I didn't tell you, did I?
Sue Fyers at work got fired.

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
[Roxy] What for?

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Flashing.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,440
-Front or back?
-[door closes]

32
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,640
Dunno, but the union's involved.
I'm staying out of it.

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,040
-Right, I've got to go.
-All right. See you later, mate.

34
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,280
Get out!

35
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
-Eh?
-[Tony] What is it?

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,400
A woman suing a doctor
for a botched surgery.

37
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,000
-[Tony] Right.
-Someone blows hot and cold, don't they?

38
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,840
Could've done with an egg,
but forget about it.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,640
What happened to you last night?
You bailed early.

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,480
Yeah, sorry. Um...

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,080
What time did you get home?

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,000
Uh... About ten.

43
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
I got in at four.

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,000
Completely smashed.

45
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,480
Covered in kebab and fanny juice.

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,200
Don't ask me how.

47
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,720
I wasn't gonna.

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,560
Did too much chang,
so I was lying in bed doing the luge...

49
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,000
till the alarm went off,
then, boom, shower! Coffee.

50
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,880
Suit straight down the dry cleaners. Work.

51
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,200
I got home and I cried a little bit.

52
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,960
Dry cleaners are used to it.
I've shat myself twice.

53
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,120
[clicks tongue] Right. Um...

54
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,480
-Just, sorry, to go back to... me.
-[therapist sighs]

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
I, um...

56
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,200
I think that I was crying
because I don't want to give up on her,

57
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,880
you know, I don't want to give up on us.
And... all I want to do is

58
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,320
just... talk to her and beg her

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,320
to let us go back to how it was.

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,880
-Matt--
-But I don't want to stifle her. I don't--

61
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,760
-Women don't want this.
-Yeah.

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,600
OK? It's pathetic.

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,440
Begging.

64
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,400
[scoffs] How is that good for a family?

65
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,200
Females choose mates
based on their strength.

66
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,480
OK? On their power.

67
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,400
Their capabilities to provide...

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,360
and keep them safe.

69
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,680
We're descended
from fucking cavemen, Matt.

70
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,160
We go out,
we kill a saber-toothed tiger,

71
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,600
we bring it back, we share it out,

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,200
and then we give the fittest bird
a good fucking seeing to.

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,480
That's where we're from.

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,120
Yeah, I just don't think
that's really... me.

75
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,240
No, it's not.

76
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,160
Being you

77
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,120
will not win her back.
It's as simple as that.

78
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
-You've tried that, didn't work.
-Yeah. No.

79
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,640
She thinks you're a loser.

80
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,560
Solution?

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,520
Be something fucking better!

82
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,280
Be something fucking stronger.

83
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,640
-Yeah?
-Mm.

84
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,640
Lie.

85
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,040
Cheat.

86
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,920
Just be a man.

87
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
But not you.

88
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,840
When did you start...
having all this done?

89
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,200
[woman] 'Bout five years ago.

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,360
Started on, like, botox...

91
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,360
and, like, filler for wrinkles an' that.

92
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,840
[Tony] How old were you?

93
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,480
Early 20s.

94
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,120
What wrinkles did you have?

95
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
[woman groans]

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,840
Dunno, like, frown lines an' that.

97
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,040
-Right.
-[woman] Yeah, then I proper got into it.

98
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,520
I just couldn't get enough.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
And then I got my lips done,

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,560
and I had a bit of a reaction.

101
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,640
But that settled down in the end.

102
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,360
And then I wanted to go bigger,
then this happened.

103
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,480
My whole face was paralyzed.
It's only just gone back to normal.

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,880
-Has it?
-Yeah.

105
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,080
My boobs leak.

106
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,720
They're fake an' all.

107
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,480
-Are they?
-[woman] Yeah.

108
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
-I mean, rock hard.
-[dull tapping]

109
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,320
-Right.
-[woman sighs]

110
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,640
Yeah.

111
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,760
Sorry, and that was the same guy...
that did your face?

112
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah. I was furious.

113
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,040
-Still am.
-[Tony] Are you?

114
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
It's hard to tell.

115
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,240
[woman] If you think
he botched my face and chest,

116
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
you should see my minge.

117
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,320
It's like a butcher's bin.

118
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,560
Sorry,

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,040
you went back to him to have your...

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,520
-Minge.
-Yeah, I know. I didn't want to say the...

121
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,080
Yeah, he did it for half price, though.
'Cause of how he'd ruined my face.

122
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,000
[Tony] Right.

123
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,480
Why would you want to have that done?

124
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,840
I think I've got a problem.

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,240
Yeah.

126
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,880
I mean, it might be...

127
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,000
like an addiction.

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,560
-What, do you mean, like, I can't help it?
-[Tony] Well, I guess so,

129
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,160
but... I mean, if you acknowledge it,
there's a chance you can...

130
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,480
get... you know, get help.

131
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,760
-Do you think I'm mental?
-Well... [sighs]

132
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,400
No more than the rest of us.

133
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,800
As I say, we're all screwed up
in one way or another.

134
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,360
It sort of makes you normal.

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
[strangled wail]

136
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,240
[chuckles wryly]

137
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,720
-Are you laughing?
-No.

138
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,720
[Tony] Crying?

139
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,000
-Oh.
-[Tony] Oh...

140
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,920
Um...

141
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,280
No, they've fucked my tear ducts.

142
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,480
-[sighs] Take a picture.
-Yeah.

143
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,080
[woman sniffs, clears throat]

144
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,400
[camera clicks]

145
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,400
-[woman] Got it?
-[Lenny] Yeah. Great.

146
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,480
-Hiya.
-[Matt] Hey.

147
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,880
Are you going
to that am-dram cabaret thing?

148
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,440
I dunno. Why?

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
Well... wondered if you'd like
to come with me?

150
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,920
-What do you mean? You mean you're going?
-[Kath] Yeah.

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,800
Thought we could have a drink before
and sit together.

152
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,480
Right. I'm not sure if I'm going.

153
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,160
Right. Well, would you like to go...

154
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,040
with me?

155
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,960
Well, with everyone, really.
Everyone's going. We'd all be there.

156
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,280
Yeah, but I'm saying
would you like to sit with me?

157
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,200
But I don't know if I'm going.
And we don't know

158
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,960
-what seats will be free.
-If you don't want

159
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,760
-to go with me, just say.
-No, it's not that.

160
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,520
-I haven't even checked my diary.
-Well, go on, then.

161
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,640
-What?
-Well, check it. It's right there.

162
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,480
Oh, no.
It's hardly on the right page, is it?

163
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,040
-There's nothing in there at the moment.
-Yeah. Right. Well, I'll, uh...

164
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,640
pencil that in, then.

165
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,360
Um, I will have to check my master diary
as well.

166
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,480
-You've got a master diary?
-Yeah.

167
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,160
I've got work here,
and then personal at home,

168
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,800
so I tend to mix and match,
actually, so... Tony?

169
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,000
Can I just... Sorry, Kath, I've got...

170
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,560
Tony, we've got our, um...

171
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,920
meeting.

172
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,040
Um... Shut the door.

173
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,440
Kath just asked me to sit next to her
at the cabaret thing.

174
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
Great.

175
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,320
-I need to get out of it.
-Why?

176
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,920
-Please help me get out of it. Please.
-How?

177
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,280
Say you're thinking
of killing yourself again.

178
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,960
Say I'm thinking
of killing myself next Thursday?

179
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,400
Well, I'll tell her, then.

180
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,240
You'll tell her you can't go with her
'cause I'm thinking of killing myself?

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,720
I'm not saying
I'm thinking of killing myself

182
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,400
'cause you're too chicken to say
you don't want to go on a date.

183
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,400
[sighs] For fuck's sake,
it's just a favor.

184
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,560
And do you know the fable,
<i>The Boy Who Cried Wolf?</i>

185
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,200
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Right.

186
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,840
So, what happens when
I really am thinking of killing myself,

187
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,360
and everyone goes, "Nah, he's just trying
to get his cowardly brother-in-law

188
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,480
out of a date"?

189
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,160
Well, no, that's different in that case,
isn't it?

190
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,640
'Cause he admitted it.
He was like, "Nah, only joking."

191
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,080
So they all knew he was lying.

192
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,120
And he kept doing it, so it was obvious.

193
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,480
We'll only use this lie once,
and we'll never admit to it.

194
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,160
So, the moral of that fable is:
"Never admit you were lying,

195
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,320
-ever..."
-Yeah.

196
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,920
"...and always use different lies
each time"?

197
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,440
Yeah.

198
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,760
Nice message.

199
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,800
-No.
-Come on.

200
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,720
No.

201
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,720
-Fuck's sake.
-You're on your own.

[Tony] There we go, Dad.

Good.

207
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,400
There. You're all right.

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,200
-Hi.
-Hiya.

[Tony's dad breathes out heavily]

210
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,040
Tony, I'm not going to sit around
and wait for you to make a move,

211
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,400
I have to get on with my life.

212
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,080
-Why are you acting weird?
<i>-I'm </i>acting weird?

213
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,560
For fuck's sake, Tony!

214
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,400
I'm just a bit fed up, all right?

215
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,040
-My wife died. My dad--
-Yes, I know.

216
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,600
Oh, sorry if that bores you.

217
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,920
Seriously? Fucking hell.

218
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,200
Was it just a drink?

219
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,920
Fuck's sake.

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,040
It's just a question. Was it just a drink?

221
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,360
[exasperated] Yes, it was just a drink!

222
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,680
OK. Good.

[plumps pillow]

But it might not always be
just a drink, though.

225
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,560
Dad, say, "Simon is a cunt."

226
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,040
What?

227
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,720
"Simon is a cunt."

228
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,480
Say it.

229
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,080
-Yeah.
-"Simon is a cunt."

230
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Remember that.

-Yeah.

Hi.

-Hi.
-I've brought you a few jumpers.

-It's getting a bit chillier outside.
-Great. Thanks.

243
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,160
[chuckles lightly] I mean, yeah,
can never have too many jumpers.

244
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,560
Um... I was gonna call you, actually.

245
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,160
Um, you know the cabaret thing

246
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,600
-that they're doing?
-Yeah.

247
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,080
I wondered if you wanted to come.

248
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,640
I'd have to sort a babysitter.

249
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,600
No, you can bring George.
It's for everyone.

250
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,880
Oh... I'm not sure.

251
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,320
Yeah. Um...
You'd be doing me a favor, actually.

-Why?

253

I think she's got a thing for me.

254
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,360
Well, tell her you can't

255
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,400
'cause you're going
with your wife and child.

256
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
Right. Yeah.

257
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,640
-Uh...
-I mean, it's nice of her, though, really,

258
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,840
'cause she probably thought
you were lonely.

-Probably.
-Yeah.

260
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,840
I was thinking of coming,

261
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,080
I just didn't know
whether George would be allowed.

-He is, yeah.
-That's good, yeah.

let's go for a nice coffee, and...

talk about really interesting things

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,280
Did I embarrass myself with Matt, then?

288
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Definitely not.

289
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,280
Why would you be embarrassed
about being honest

290
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,400
and saying something nice?
He should be flattered.

291
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,720
I think he was scared!

I'm obviously not his type.

Someone just got there first.

294
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,960
But, um... you didn't do anything wrong.

295
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,360
You showed your feelings.

I...

300
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,680
Sometimes, I'd be embarrassed
to hold hands in public.

301
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,480
Or if we were on the phone
and there was people around,

302

she'd always say, "Bye. Love you."

303
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,200
And I would go, "Me too."

304
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,200
And she'd laugh, 'cause she'd know.

305
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,880
Yeah.

Sometimes, I was out, working late.

307
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,600
The phone would go, and I'd think,
"Oh, God, what's happened?"

308
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,520
And I'd go, "Hello?"
I'd go, "What's wrong?" And, um...

309
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,160
she'd say,
"Nothing's wrong, I just love you."

-Sure.

about your wife calling you.

-See you later.

is drink alone.

Mm...

326

Nice.

327

[Tony] Lisa was my greatest achievement.

328
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,840
I've never done anything else, really.
Not of worth.

329
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,160
Nothing else to be proud of.

330
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Just that.

331
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,680
I won at life.

332
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
You did.

333
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,280
I'm not as good as her,
and I'm proud of that. [chuckles]

334
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,040
You're just different.

335
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,360
I'm angry. I'm petty. I'm sad.

336
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,320
I'm jealous of anyone
who's still got someone.

337
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,920
How did you get Lisa if you were so bad?

338
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
I'm not sure.

339
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,440
I was just nice to her, I think.

340
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,440
You should try that again.

341

[both chuckle]

342
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,640
I miss her so much.

343
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,400
I feel sad all the time.

344
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,400
I'm not the person I was.

345
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,240
Lisa dying, I just... It's like...

346
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,680
I lost most of me, and all the good stuff,
all the happiness...

348
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,600
I feel like I'm nothing, you know?

349
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,960
That's not true.

350
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,640
People think that I'm sort of OK,
you know,

351
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,760
like I'm getting on with it,
I'm snarky now and again,

352
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,120
and that this is a lapse,
but it's not.

353
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,240
This is me all the time now.

354
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,360
Everything else is the front, you know?

355
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,520
I'm not well, but I remember

356
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,040
what it was like to be normal,
so I do an impression of that.

357
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,960
But this is what I really am.

358
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,160
And I want to be normal again...

When Lisa was dying,
I tried to be brave and put a...

361
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,080
you know, a face on, to be positive,

362
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,160
and even then, I'd break down sometimes,
and she'd... [voice cracks]

363
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,840
...have to comfort me.

364
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,880
I couldn't even give her that.
When she was dying, she was still on duty.

365

Please don't.

A lot of people rely on it. And, um...

396
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,760
I mean, how much will you make
from selling it?

397
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Half a million.

398
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,600
Right... Yeah.

399
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
That's a lot.

Uh...

416
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,040
So, when, um, Lisa, my wife,

417
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,480
when she died,

418
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,080
I was suicidal, and depressed.

419
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,120
And everyone was so nice,
everyone tried to help me and...

420
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,400
they sort of saved me, so...
I wanted to do something nice back.

421
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,840
But, um, anyway, you're a nice guy,
and I just want you to know,

422
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,760
you know, the whole story, and, uh...

423
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,000
I mean, if you weren't to sell it, um,

424
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,880
we could... you know, give it another go.

425
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,720
If it didn't work out,
you could sell it next year.

426
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,400
It might work, and...

427
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,560
we could do with someone...
who cared about... success,

428
