2
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:12,165
Keep being funny.

3
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:16,525
Tell jokes... at the funeral,
or at the party after.

4
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,645
There'd better be a party after.

5
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:22,805
You're always funny at parties. You
always get drunk and overexcited.

6
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:26,685
Running around like a fat, little
annoying Santa with your rosy cheeks,

7
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:28,125
making everyone laugh.

8
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,925
Then you have a sort of
spiritual hangover the next day,

9
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:32,685
worried you'd offended so and so.

10
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:35,125
You never had, though.

11
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:37,885
You just made 'em laugh.

12
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:39,685
Just keep being funny.

13
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:42,165
You're a lovely man.

14
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:45,525
You all right, George?

15
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:49,925
What's the matter?

16
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:52,085
Robbie hit me.

17
00:01:52,725 --> 00:01:53,725
Why?

18
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:55,605
He always does, every day.

19
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:57,445
Which one's Robbie?

20
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,405
- Stop it!
- The one with the branch?

21
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:06,245
Are you Robbie?

22
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:08,605
- Yeah.
- Robbie, come here.

23
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:10,565
Listen up, right?

24
00:02:11,485 --> 00:02:13,165
I'm an escaped lunatic,

25
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:15,845
and I like murdering
little fat kids like you,

26
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:19,205
so if you hit George or anyone
else, I'm gonna come to your house...

27
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:20,285
I know where you live...

28
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:21,115
and while you're asleep,

29
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:23,221
I'm gonna smash your stupid
head in with this hammer.

30
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:24,245
Do you understand?

31
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:31,925
I just threatened a
ten-year-old kid with a hammer.

32
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:33,685
They've gotta learn.

33
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:35,405
He was bullying George, and I said

34
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:38,605
I'd murder him in his
sleep if he did it again.

35
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:46,085
- Oh... Hello.
- Hi.

36
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:48,805
He's going to murder a kid with a hammer

37
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:50,205
if it doesn't behave.

38
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:54,525
So did you... go on your date, then?

39
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:55,605
Yeah.

40
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,085
Was it a success?

41
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:59,525
No, it was... awful...

42
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:03,125
awkward... just the worst.

43
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:04,985
The one good thing about my life

44
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:06,965
is that I never have
to do that shit again.

45
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:08,485
Oh, I know what you mean.

46
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,885
You know, I'm genuinely happy on my own.

47
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:11,965
Just me and the dog.

48
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:14,005
- Me and my cat.
- Exactly.

49
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:17,365
When the dog goes, and him,

50
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:21,405
I'll have no responsibility
for anything ever again.

51
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,325
I can do what I like.

52
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:24,725
Mm-hm.

53
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:28,045
Well, you'll never have
to come here again, so...

54
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,125
- Right.
- Okay.

55
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:35,805
- I've gotta...
- Yeah.

56
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:37,445
- See you.
- See you later.

57
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:50,645
Valerie, erm...

58
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,925
call me when my girlfriend
gets here, please.

59
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,605
But you'll see her.

60
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,485
What?

61
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:58,085
Yeah, just call me, huh?

62
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,045
She's bringing me a treat.

63
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:01,685
Women.

64
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:03,245
Bloody love 'em though.

65
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:09,045
- Oh, hey. How was the date?
- The worst.

66
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,125
- Oh no.
- Yeah.

67
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:11,203
I thought you'd have so much in common.

68
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:13,221
Well, she didn't want to be there,

69
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:15,565
she drank like a fish,
swore like a trooper,

70
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:18,365
err, she was narcissistic, rude.

71
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:19,445
Yeah, exactly.

72
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:22,250
Good one. Luckily, I got it in first

73
00:04:22,251 --> 00:04:23,445
that I didn't want to be there either,

74
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:25,765
and that I miss my wife, and that...

75
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:27,685
I wanna kill myself.

76
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:31,005
And then she teased me that
I couldn't commit suicide

77
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:32,245
as well as her dead husband.

78
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:33,901
- Sounds brilliant.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:36,485
Then I tried to knock a
couple of muggers off a moped.

80
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:38,245
Stole their hammer.

81
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:39,525
You were mugged again?

82
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:40,605
No.

83
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:41,925
A woman was...

84
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:43,405
But as they went past me.

85
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:47,245
I've always wanted to knock
a twat off a motorbike.

86
00:04:47,325 --> 00:04:49,645
I hate the way they
rev up for no reason.

87
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:53,165
The fact they were muggers was
a bonus. It sort of justified it.

88
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,245
And what d'you mean,
you stole their hammer?

89
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:58,005
I confiscated it, really.
They dropped it, so I thought,

90
00:04:58,085 --> 00:04:59,920
"I'll have that." It's
a good one as well,

91
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:03,045
so not a complete waste of an evening.

92
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:10,085
Good.

93
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,325
Can I just talk to you
about something a sec?

94
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:14,765
Yeah.

95
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:27,605
Did you hear about Julian?

96
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,925
- The guy who distributes the newspapers.
- Yeah.

97
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:32,885
He was found dead this morning.

98
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:35,005
From an overdose, heroin.

99
00:05:37,285 --> 00:05:38,285
Yep.

100
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:41,125
It's so sad. I didn't even...

101
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:43,085
I... I had no idea.

102
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:46,965
I gave him the money.

103
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,125
For what?

104
00:05:50,845 --> 00:05:51,845
For drugs.

105
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,805
Yeah, but you couldn't have known
that he would overdose, though.

106
00:05:57,685 --> 00:05:58,525
Well...

107
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:00,205
- Fuck's sake, Tony.
- What?

108
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:02,925
Don't say that. Don't even
joke about things like that.

109
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:04,925
What? Why? What's...

110
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:07,245
Because you're the godfather to my son.

111
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:09,765
- Right...
- Because you're not a fucking psychopath.

112
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:11,085
- Okay.
- Why would you say...

113
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,805
Why would you even tell me that?

114
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:15,605
You didn't know.

115
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,045
- Just tell me you didn't know.
- Right. I couldn't know...

116
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,725
- Right.
- ... it was gonna...

117
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:23,205
you know, work.

118
00:06:23,245 --> 00:06:25,845
Work? Are you fucking kidding me?

119
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:28,725
He was a heroin addict,
okay? That's what he did.

120
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,365
Right? It's what he wanted, obviously.

121
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:33,061
- So...
- Tell me that you didn't know

122
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:34,451
that he was gonna kill himself,

123
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:36,925
or I'm not gonna let you
see George again, okay?

124
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:39,805
I didn't know.

125
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,525
Obviously not.

126
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:44,725
Okay.

127
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:47,245
You didn't... Yeah, you didn't know.

128
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:54,605
Here she is.

129
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,605
- Who?
- My bird.

130
00:06:57,445 --> 00:06:59,565
- My bird.
- Come in. Take a seat.

131
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,925
- Bread pudding delivery.
- Lovely. Thanks, love.

132
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:07,805
Um, everyone, it's my
girlfriend, June. June, everyone.

133
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,525
- Hello.
- Hi, June.

134
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:12,925
So... what's it like going out with...

135
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:14,925
that?

136
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:17,365
It's lovely.

137
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:18,365
- Is it?
- Yeah.

138
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,045
What do you mean?

139
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,365
He's good with my boy.

140
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:22,965
- Right.
- Got a lot in common,

141
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:24,525
- my two little fatties.
- Oh.

142
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:27,125
I love it when they
fight over Creme Eggs.

143
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:28,565
- Not fighting.
- You do.

144
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,485
No, he's just... He gets a bit grabby.

145
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:33,795
Ahh. He tells me you were
attracted to his style

146
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:35,365
even before his personality.

147
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:37,565
- Yeah.
- Wow.

148
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:39,365
- Love everything about him.
- Right.

149
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:41,285
Especially his body.

150
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:44,645
Really? Wh... wh... why?

151
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,485
Why? What's...

152
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:47,565
He's 'ot.

153
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,440
- 'Ot?
- Yeah, like his body temperature's warm,

154
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:52,685
like hot to the touch.

155
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,845
- Oh, right.
- So when he's naked, it's like cuddling

156
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:56,141
- a big baby.
- Oh.

157
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:58,805
And his skin's dead smooth
when he gets out the bath.

158
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,765
Very cuddly, yeah.

159
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:04,605
And have you noticed the roll of, um...

160
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:07,125
flab on his neck?

161
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,925
- Back fat?
- No, not back fat,

162
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:10,845
but we'll come back to that, thank you.

163
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,965
Um, no. Next time he's lying naked,

164
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:17,205
just grab the back of his neck.
Or get on him, if you like.

165
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:20,125
Sit on him, grab the roll
of fat on his back there,

166
00:08:20,205 --> 00:08:24,205
and blump him around the room
like a biiiig space hopper.

167
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:26,141
- That'd be good.
- Don't want to hurt him, do I?

168
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:28,445
- No. You just wanna cudd... I know.

169
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,485
Wanna see a sexy picture
of him just out the bath?

170
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:32,525
- Yes, please, June.
- I've got one 'ere.

171
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:35,325
You should probably... head
off, love, shouldn't you?

172
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:37,061
- Yeah.
- Well, come back any time, though,

173
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,525
'cause we're a local paper,
so we need sort of... Ahhh!

174
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:42,165
We need sort of local
interest stories like this.

175
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:44,365
- Ah, I forgot the custard.
- Not to worry.

176
00:08:44,445 --> 00:08:46,205
Okay, next time, though.

177
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:49,021
- Never mind.
- Yeah, all right. See you, love.

178
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:51,885
- Thanks for...
- See you later.

179
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:52,965
Nice to meet you all.

180
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:55,181
- Nice to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you. Cheers.

181
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:56,581
- Ta-ra.
- Thanks for the pud.

182
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:57,925
You're welcome!

183
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:01,805
- Fuckin' hell.
- You make a lovely couple.

184
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:03,045
Cheers.

185
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:06,965
Someone for everyone, isn't there?

186
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:09,245
Thanks.

187
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:12,165
She's brilliant, mate.

188
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:14,045
Cheers.

189
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:30,965
- Oh.
- Hi.

190
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:32,845
Hi. Twice in one day?

191
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:37,205
- Somebody's popular.
- It's just a slow workday, so...

192
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,085
- Wish I had a slow workday.
- You busy?

193
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:41,005
Err... Yeah, just a bit.

194
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:43,725
Just... Well, have a sit down.

195
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,245
That's all I've got.

196
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:56,205
God.

197
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,725
Okay, back to work.

198
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,525
- Bye!
- Bye.

199
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:08,125
Well, I didn't breastfeed this time,

200
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:09,725
not convenient.

201
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:13,485
Obviously, I was still lactating,
so I thought, "Waste not, want not,"

202
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:15,365
so I expressed...

203
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:17,485
and started making rice puddings.

204
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,045
- Out of your breast milk?
- Good idea.

205
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,125
It's more natural, if you
think about it, isn't it?

206
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:25,085
For people to eat a pudding
made from human milk.

207
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:26,605
That's what we're used to, isn't it?

208
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:28,125
Well, when we're babies maybe.

209
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:29,725
So I kept expressing...

210
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:31,765
And making... rice puddings.

211
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:33,365
Do other people eat these?

212
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,845
Yeah, they lap it up.

213
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,365
And they know it's your breast milk?

214
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:37,405
Yeah.

215
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:39,125
Who eats these?

216
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,885
Mr. Crosby at number five.

217
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:42,285
He can't get enough.

218
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:44,565
- I mean, I can't make huge puddings.
- Sure.

219
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,525
Sometimes I have to top
it up with cow's milk.

220
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:47,645
Right.

221
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:49,005
Anyway, do you want to try?

222
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:51,685
Nah. We're fine, thank you...

223
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:56,965
Oh. Oh, God!

224
00:10:57,045 --> 00:10:58,485
Are you okay?

225
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:00,685
No, it's the sight of him just...

226
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:03,005
slurping it up like a fat...

227
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:04,085
fuckin' Labrador.

228
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:05,405
Oh, god.

229
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,445
It's...

230
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:09,125
Oh, God.

231
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:11,965
Change the subject.

232
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:14,445
So for the bread, I use
my own vaginal yeast.

233
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:18,805
Thank you.

234
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:24,365
You never need to use your own
vaginal yeast to make bread.

235
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:26,965
If you're making bread,
"Oh, we've run out of yeast.

236
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:28,725
Oh, I know. I can use... Forget it.

237
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:31,045
I'll go to the shops.
We'll get a lovely loaf."

238
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,805
You've still got the fuckin'
milk around your mouth.

239
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:35,005
Oh, you pig.

240
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:38,885
I've got to walk the
dog. I'll see you later.

241
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,165
All right?

242
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:19,845
- Yeah.
- Been waiting for you.

243
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,125
Why?

244
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:22,725
Postcard.

245
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:24,685
- Who's that from?
- You, obviously.

246
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:26,325
What's it say?

247
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:27,965
- You know what it says.
- Go on.

248
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,365
"To Pat. Stop reading my
postcards, you nosy, scruffy cunt."

249
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:36,405
Not very nice, is it?

250
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:38,845
It's not addressed to you,
is it? It's addressed to me.

251
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,205
Yeah, but you knew I'd read it.

252
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:41,405
And that's my point.

253
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:44,445
Good girl. Come on.

254
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:47,885
I'm always angry.

255
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:49,005
Yeah.

256
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,965
I hate the fact that people think...

257
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:54,165
they can get away with
being shit, you know?

258
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,525
I was wound up the other day

259
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,925
by a woman walking along
the street next to me,

260
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:01,165
and she was shuffling.
She wouldn't pick her...

261
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:02,325
Pick your fuckin' feet up.

262
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,365
Has no one ever told
you how to fuckin' walk?

263
00:13:04,445 --> 00:13:07,445
You're an adult. I wanted to
punch a bloke in the cafe yesterday

264
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:08,685
for yawning too loudly.

265
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:09,925
He was doing this...

266
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,765
Shut the fuck up!

267
00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:13,845
No one cares.

268
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:16,005
It's like celebrating being tired.

269
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:20,725
We all get irritated by things, okay?

270
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:23,245
I hate people who eat the
ice in their gin and tonics.

271
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:24,485
So do I.

272
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:27,885
But I bet your first thought
isn't, "I hope he chokes on that,

273
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:30,725
and as he's on the
floor gasping for air,

274
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:32,005
I wanna lean in and go,

275
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:35,365
"That's what you get for
eating ice, you fuckin' moron."

276
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:37,005
No, it isn't.

277
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:39,445
Welcome to the contents of my head.

278
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:46,285
Excuse me.

279
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,405
- Spare a moment for homeless children?
- Sorry, no.

280
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:56,285
Oh, don't care about
children in poverty then?

281
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:58,885
Not at the moment. I've
got bigger problems.

282
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:01,445
Do bigger problems exist than
the desperate poverty of a child?

283
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:04,365
Sorry, I thought me saying
I was busy was enough.

284
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:07,645
What's the guilt tripping? And
don't give me this altruism shit.

285
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:10,685
You're not a volunteer. Everyone
knows you're getting paid.

286
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:13,138
You don't give a fuck about the
charity or poverty-stricken kids.

287
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:16,085
You want money. I'd effectively
be paying your wages,

288
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,565
you wiry, little twat.

289
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,525
Four-eyes!

290
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:43,645
Oh.

291
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:45,525
Please can I be in the paper?

292
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:47,965
- For what?
- Me.

293
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:50,645
- My story.
- What story?

294
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:51,725
I've got stories.

295
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:53,845
You'll do stories about
anything in here, won't you?

296
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:55,965
What was it last week,
"Woman Finds Hat in a Tree"?

297
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:57,645
Please...

298
00:14:57,725 --> 00:14:59,285
come and have a look at my home.

299
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,541
- Why?
- This is just the tip of the iceberg.

300
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:03,765
- You don't know.
- No, I believe you.

301
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:05,565
It's a tr... trevor
tro... treasure trove.

302
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:08,461
- Easy for you to say.
- Collected loads of things over the years.

303
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:10,645
Memorabilia and trophies and...

304
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:12,085
my exploits.

305
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:16,165
If you're not convinced, I promise
I'll never darken your door again.

306
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:18,685
So if we come and look at your house,

307
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:20,125
you'll never bother us...

308
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:21,205
Never. No.

309
00:15:23,165 --> 00:15:24,165
It'll make my year.

310
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:27,925
D'you wanna go have a look?

311
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:29,485
Yeah.

312
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:31,605
Please bring the new girl.

313
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,765
D'you want to watch us cover this story?

314
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:35,765
- Yeah. All right.
- Yeah?

315
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:44,205
Here we go.

316
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:48,765
Here we are.

317
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:53,485
- Fuckin' hell.
- Come in.

318
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,445
This is the dining room.

319
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,445
Okay, come through.

320
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:05,925
This is what I've been
talking about. This is...

321
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:12,045
Questions?

322
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:14,605
- What's that smell?
- Which one?

323
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:16,525
Like a clawing thing in
the back of the throat.

324
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:18,245
- Back of the throat. Dead mice.
- Yeah...

325
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,765
Back of the room. Back corner.
Basically, I put some traps there

326
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:24,325
a couple of years ago, and
I can't get to them, so...

327
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,165
Any other questions?

328
00:16:28,165 --> 00:16:29,605
- What are they?
- Cockroaches.

329
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:33,525
I collect them. Basically,
these little fellas are um...

330
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:34,685
- Don't open it.
- Okay.

331
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,045
My rule is, if you come onto
my property, then I own you.

332
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:40,485
Okay?

333
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:42,365
Question three?

334
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:44,565
- How long have you been doing this?
- Ooh.

335
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:47,645
When did my wife leave me?

336
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:48,725
Seven years.

337
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:51,726
Seven years ago. I just thought I
could do what I like with the place.

338
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:55,805
- So I just went for it.
- Yeah, which brings me to my next question,

339
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:57,845
- and don't take this the wrong way...
- No.

340
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,565
Why have you never considered suicide?

341
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:00,645
I have.

342
00:17:01,325 --> 00:17:03,205
And why... didn't you
go through with it?

343
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:05,485
Because I decided it
was too good for me.

344
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:06,765
Wow.

345
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,085
That's what you're dealing with.

346
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:10,965
- Cup of tea?
- Definitely not.

347
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:12,005
Okay.

348
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:15,765
Brian, this isn't right for a
local paper. How can I do a...

349
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:18,125
There's no story here, mate.

350
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,165
Can I stay and try and find one?

351
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:21,965
- Really?
- Yeah.

352
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:23,365
Okay.

353
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:25,325
See you later.

354
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:27,725
- Cheers, Brian.
- Yeah.

355
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:29,205
- Thank you.
- Bye.

356
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,225
Where are you going?

357
00:17:30,205 --> 00:17:31,845
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

358
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:34,101
Don't leave her with him.

359
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,365
- It stinks.
- Yeah.

360
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:37,645
What d'you wanna know?
Where'd you wanna go?

361
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,485
Just show me what you've got, really.

362
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:42,525
What I've got? What haven't I got?

363
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:48,685
Okay, thank you. Yeah.

364
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:50,645
No, thanks for letting me know.

365
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:59,925
Hello, everybody! Hello!

366
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:01,925
Hello, everybody! Hello.

367
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,165
Say hello, everybody.

368
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:04,845
- Hello.
- Hello.

369
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:06,165
Hello, Mr. Punch.

370
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:08,141
Hello, Mrs. Punch. What are you up to?

371
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:10,365
Oh, nothing much. Nothing much.

372
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:12,885
Yes, you have. You've been
shagging Mickey the Gypsy.

373
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:14,085
No, I haven't.

374
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:15,605
Yes, you have.

375
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,325
Ooh, calm down, Brian.

376
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:19,565
Calm down? You're
telling me to calm down?

377
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:22,021
Huh? You've made me a laughing
stock around the village,

378
00:18:22,045 --> 00:18:23,405
and she's telling me to calm down.

379
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:25,485
She's been shagging anything that moves.

380
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:28,685
For 18 months, she's shagging
Mickey the Gypsy down Green Lane.

381
00:18:29,165 --> 00:18:31,525
My wife is a slut.
There's your headline.

382
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:32,805
"My Wife's a Slut."

383
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:35,485
This woman has destroyed me.

384
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:38,765
Yes, please, take a picture. Thank you.

385
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,245
Tony, can I have a word?

386
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:51,605
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

387
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:56,365
Shut the door.

388
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:58,405
Sit down.

389
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:02,325
I just had a phone call from the school.

390
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:05,085
Not as a story or
anything, but as a parent.

391
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:07,541
Apparently, a middle-aged man
threatened a ten-year-old child

392
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:08,565
with a hammer today.

393
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:12,765
You threatened a child
with a fucking hammer.

394
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:14,165
Who told you it was me?

395
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:15,805
Nobody. They don't know it was you.

396
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:18,085
I know it was you 'cause
I've seen the fucking hammer.

397
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:20,685
He was bullying George.

398
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:23,125
What the fuck is wrong
with you, Tony? I can't...

399
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:26,725
I can take all the insults,
you know, the lateness.

400
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:29,005
Fill your boots with that
shit, but you can't...

401
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,125
If you carry on like this,
people are gonna get hurt, right?

402
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,501
- And it's not gonna be George.
- I know.

403
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:35,325
I was trying to stop
George getting hurt.

404
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:37,005
I get enough grief from Jill as it is,

405
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:38,765
letting George see you, but I do it

406
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:41,245
because I know it makes you happy,

407
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:44,445
but I can't risk that
anymore. Do you understand?

408
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:52,125
- I'm fucked up.
- You're not fuck... that's not good enough.

409
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:53,965
That is not good enough, Tony.

410
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:56,165
That's letting yourself
off the hook again.

411
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:59,165
People who are fucked up
don't choose to be like that.

412
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:01,221
You're doing this on purpose.
You know what you're doing.

413
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:02,725
This is the worst thing you've done.

414
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:05,285
I don't even know what
you're fighting anymore.

415
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:08,445
I don't get this, okay? There
is no enemy in this story.

416
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:10,301
This is... You're just
doing this to yourself.

417
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:13,285
I'm in pain, all right? I'm
in fucking pain all the time,

418
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:14,845
and I do shit like this...

419
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:17,485
... 'cause it makes me feel
better for a split second.

420
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:20,245
Other people are in pain as well.
Other people have shit going on.

421
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,245
Other people have things
they need to deal with.

422
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:23,685
I just want to be out of pain.

423
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,245
Either live without
pain or die without pain,

424
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,685
whichever one comes first.

425
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:30,165
- I choose that, all right?
- Okay, listen to me.

426
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:33,685
If you're saying to me
that you can't be trusted,

427
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:37,085
that you're not accountable for
your actions, then that's fine,

428
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:38,525
if that's what you're saying.

429
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,485
But that means that you
don't get to see George.

430
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:42,420
Because if you're
saying I have to choose

431
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:44,725
between the safety of my son...

432
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:45,805
and you,

433
00:20:45,885 --> 00:20:49,125
then I choose my son every
fucking time. Do you understand me?

434
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:50,605
It doesn't even come close.

435
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:54,901
- I'd never do anything to hurt George.
- Look what you've done already.

436
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:55,925
I know.

437
00:20:56,925 --> 00:20:58,605
I won't do anything like this again.

438
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:00,405
Well, let's see, okay?

439
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:12,245
What was it like?

440
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,205
- Absolutely mental.
- Why?

441
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:17,405
It's just full of shit.

442
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:18,605
Just old shit.

443
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,885
He did a puppet show!

444
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:23,605
- Puppet show?
- Yeah, like an actual puppet show.

445
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:25,645
How are you even gonna deal with that?

446
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:26,725
It's quite sad.

447
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:28,565
Excited to start it.

448
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,445
Why is it empty?

449
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:33,085
What d'you mean?

450
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:34,850
Well, usually, there's like a...

451
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:37,605
romantic scene or a
castle or something inside.

452
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:39,965
Yeah. This is one of them
that you're meant to put

453
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:42,165
a photo of a loved one in, but...

454
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:43,525
I haven't met anyone, though.

455
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:45,405
Fuck me.

456
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,125
Put something in it.

457
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:48,965
Picture of your cat,

458
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:50,685
something you love.

459
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:52,885
What d'you love?

460
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:56,245
Loads of stuff.

461
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:57,365
Go on.

462
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,525
Go on what?

463
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:03,085
What d'you mean "Go on what"?

464
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:04,765
What?

465
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:06,485
I said, "Go on,"

466
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:09,405
and you said, "Go on what?"

467
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:12,485
You haven't heard the phrase, "go on,"

468
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,605
as in expound,

469
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:16,405
give me some examples?

470
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:19,205
- No.
- No?

471
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:21,165
Okay.

472
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:23,685
Give me some examples
of things you love.

473
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:30,405
Having a laugh.

474
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:32,245
- Really?
- Yeah!

475
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:35,045
You've seen the birthday
cards I buy people.

476
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,605
Funny memes I show around on Twitter.

477
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:40,845
Kevin Hart.

478
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:04,125
- Fancy seeing you here.
- Oh.

479
00:23:05,325 --> 00:23:06,725
- You all right?
- Yeah.

480
00:23:07,445 --> 00:23:08,445
Good.

481
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:10,925
Erm...

482
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:12,925
I need some advice.

483
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:15,285
I wanted to kill myself.

484
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:18,085
And when I couldn't, or hadn't,

485
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,405
I thought, "Okay.

486
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:23,765
If I'm gonna do this
carrying on living thing,

487
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:27,125
it's gonna be on my terms,
I'm gonna do what I want,

488
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,325
and I've always got
suicide to fall back on."

489
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:33,005
Got to have a backup.

490
00:23:36,005 --> 00:23:37,165
Exactly.

491
00:23:37,645 --> 00:23:38,925
But it didn't go to plan.

492
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:40,525
Erm...

493
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:43,285
At first, I thought it
was like a superpower.

494
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:46,125
I can do anything. Who cares?

495
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:47,605
What's the worst that can happen?

496
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:51,205
Nothing can hurt me because I can
always kill myself, you know? And...

497
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:53,085
But then...

498
00:23:53,645 --> 00:23:54,885
I realized you can't...

499
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:58,445
You can't not care about
things you actually care about.

500
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:00,445
You can't fool yourself and...

501
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:02,445
And, err...

502
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:06,485
it was something you said,
that it's not all about me,

503
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:09,085
and even though I'm in pain,

504
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:11,085
it's worth...

505
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:14,005
sticking around to maybe...

506
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,125
make my...

507
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:20,445
little corner of the world
a slightly better place.

508
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,405
That's all there is.

509
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,005
Happiness is amazing.

510
00:24:29,405 --> 00:24:32,165
It's so amazing, it doesn't
matter if it's yours or not.

511
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:35,565
There's that lovely thing,

512
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,565
"A society grows great
when old men plant trees,

513
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,285
the shade of which they
know they will never sit in."

514
00:24:44,245 --> 00:24:47,285
Good people do things for other people.

515
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:48,805
That's it. The end.

516
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:53,605
And you're good, Tony.

517
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:56,445
You have so much to give.

518
00:24:58,645 --> 00:24:59,885
Smart...

519
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:00,965
fun...

520
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:03,565
lovely.

521
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:08,085
You forgot "sexy," but...

522
00:25:08,165 --> 00:25:09,165
Yeah, well,

523
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:11,925
didn't want to be too obvious.

524
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:15,285
- If you were 20 years younger, right?
- Exactly.

525
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:21,565
Mind you, if I was 20 years
younger, I think I could do better.

526
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:25,445
Yeah, definitely.

527
00:25:27,805 --> 00:25:28,805
Ah.

528
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,445
All right, I'm off.

529
00:25:37,645 --> 00:25:38,645
Bye.

530
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:41,285
- See you tomorrow.
- See ya.

531
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:54,125
- See ya.
- Bye.

532
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:30,845
- Tony.
- Huh?

533
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:32,565
Please be happy.

534
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:34,245
What?

535
00:26:34,285 --> 00:26:35,965
You deserve to be happy.

536
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,125
Please be happy.

537
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:39,965
I love how much you love your wife,

538
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:45,125
and I can't wait for someone to love
me as much as you love your wife.

539
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:48,125
But... you can still be happy.

540
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:49,485
Okay.

541
00:26:50,445 --> 00:26:51,645
You're so funny.

542
00:26:52,165 --> 00:26:53,725
You make me laugh all the time.

543
00:26:54,285 --> 00:26:55,965
Tony, you're breaking my heart.

544
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:57,045
Okay.

545
00:27:01,965 --> 00:27:04,405
- How's the Brian story going?
- Yeah, I've got it here.

546
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:06,885
- Do you want to read it?
- Yep.

547
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:25,285
Well,

548
00:27:25,365 --> 00:27:26,685
this can be the front page.

549
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:28,925
- Really?
- Yeah.

550
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:31,525
Oh, my God. I could cry.

551
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:34,445
Don't cry, and don't be too flattered.
Have you seen our front pages?

552
00:27:34,525 --> 00:27:35,885
Yeah.

553
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:37,485
But still...

554
00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:39,085
It's really good.

555
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:41,485
- Really good.
- Thank you.

556
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:15,205
No way!

557
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:17,245
Tony!

558
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:20,925
Oh, my God!

559
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:24,245
Hello!

560
00:28:24,325 --> 00:28:25,725
Hello, you!

561
00:28:26,365 --> 00:28:27,365
Hello.

562
00:28:28,885 --> 00:28:31,125
Wow. This is your new home.

563
00:28:31,205 --> 00:28:33,245
- Oh, God.
- My God, Tony.

564
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:34,445
Look at that face.

565
00:28:34,525 --> 00:28:36,845
She is gorgeous.

566
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:55,045
- Hey.
- You all right?

567
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:59,325
I knew I'd find you at the office.

568
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:03,005
Prostitute.

569
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:06,085
Sex worker.
