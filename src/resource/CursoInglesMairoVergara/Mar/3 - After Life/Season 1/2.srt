2
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:12,965
I don't want you to grieve forever.

3
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,885
I mean, grieve a bit.

4
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,765
I want everyone in
floods at the funeral.

5
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:20,525
But don't spiral, don't obsess.

6
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:21,885
Keep going.

7
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:24,645
Get up. Don't mope about in bed all day.

8
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:26,525
Get out. Open the curtains.

9
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:28,165
Enjoy the sun

10
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:29,245
while you can.

11
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:02,285
Hungry?

12
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:10,925
If you could open a
tin, I'd be dead now.

13
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:12,845
But you can't, can ya?

14
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:14,645
'Cause you're useless.

15
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:17,085
Who's useless? Who's useless?

16
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:18,525
You are!

17
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:19,965
You are.

18
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:21,365
You're useless.

19
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:23,605
Good girl.

20
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,085
Do you still want me to
put it through the door?

21
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:47,565
No, you can give it to me.

22
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:51,245
Just a postcard from Mike
and Beth, whoever they are.

23
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:53,165
Friends.

24
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:54,605
What's it say?

25
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:56,285
Just says, "Having a great time, and...

26
00:01:56,805 --> 00:01:57,885
Mike's had diarrhea."

27
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,125
Good.

28
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:04,445
Well, let's hope you're still
my postman when I'm blind.

29
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,045
Go on.

30
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:16,526
Well, we went to that
nice Greek restaurant

31
00:02:16,527 --> 00:02:19,645
that we usually go to. You know
that one at the top of the road?

32
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:22,805
Well, Sheila was in a
terrible mood again. Well...

33
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:27,125
I'm going mad.

34
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:30,245
You're only mad if they answer back.

35
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:32,405
He does answer back.

36
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:36,445
What's he say?

37
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:38,405
Depends what I ask him.

38
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:40,445
'Course.

39
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:43,325
Your mum?

40
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:47,045
My wife.

41
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:48,885
Oh.

42
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:50,965
Sorry.

43
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,525
Stan was my husband.

44
00:02:56,685 --> 00:02:57,685
I'm Anne.

45
00:02:58,605 --> 00:02:59,605
I'm Tony.

46
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:02,365
Nice to meet you.

47
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:08,925
He seems nice.

48
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:11,605
- Does he agree?
- Of course.

49
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:14,405
Never disagreed with me once.

50
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,525
Not in 48 years.

51
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:21,725
I didn't get that long.

52
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:47,325
I met a nice lady in the graveyard, Dad.

53
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,205
Don't tell Lisa.

54
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:53,365
Fuck me.

55
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:56,405
She's more your age.

56
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:00,565
A bit of Viagra...

57
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:01,645
Bob's your uncle.

58
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:05,365
Is he?

59
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:08,005
Always nice to chat.

60
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:10,685
Right, here we go at last.

61
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:12,685
- Hi.
- Sorry about that. Hi.

62
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:14,485
Right, cuppa tea.

63
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,165
Two sugars.

64
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:19,285
Right, let's get you
sorted, give you a wee comb.

65
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:23,005
Doesn't look too bad, actually, does it?

66
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:27,165
It's nice out there today. We'll
get out in the garden later on, eh?

67
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:31,165
I don't know how you do it.

68
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,765
- What?
- Stay sane.

69
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:36,565
He doesn't know what
you're on about, does he?

70
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:38,365
He doesn't remember you, I bet.

71
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:40,205
He doesn't know he's alive.

72
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:42,885
- What is the point?
- What do you mean, "What's the point?"

73
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:44,725
They helped us when they could,

74
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:47,645
now they can't. He can't
even help himself, so I do.

75
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:50,405
No, I know. But is it for the best?

76
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:52,805
We don't know what they're feeling.

77
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:53,885
They don't know.

78
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:55,285
So just in case,

79
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,245
be nice to them, eh?

80
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:04,445
My dad's completely gone now.

81
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:06,405
I feel bad that I resent

82
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:08,605
having to visit him every day,

83
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:10,725
but I know I'd feel bad if
I didn't visit every day.

84
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:12,365
And then when I do visit him every day,

85
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,165
I feel bad when I leave
'cause it was so depressing.

86
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:18,485
I know I'm not thinking straight,
but I don't wanna think straight

87
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:21,845
'cause when I do, I get even
more fucking depressed because...

88
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:23,565
I just wanna sleep.

89
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,685
You know, I haven't...

90
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:27,645
Sorry, am I boring you?

91
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:29,820
I just got into an argument on Twitter

92
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:32,365
with some absolute
moron medical student.

93
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,645
Now he's decided to block me
'cause he couldn't take it.

94
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:37,365
It's pathetic.

95
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:39,165
It is, yeah.

96
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:41,605
I'd love to meet him.

97
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:45,485
- Yeah?
- And fucking give him a good hiding.

98
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:57,005
Off to buy some smack?

99
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:58,325
Yep.

100
00:05:58,485 --> 00:05:59,965
How much do you get for that then?

101
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:01,845
Err, just, um...

102
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:03,085
It's like a little bag.

103
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,845
I might join you one day.

104
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:08,685
Yeah, anytime.

105
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:09,765
Tonight?

106
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:11,685
Err...

107
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:12,765
How do you mean?

108
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,205
I wanna try heroin tonight.

109
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:16,805
What, you? Really?

110
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:17,885
Yeah.

111
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:19,445
Why not? Fuck it.

112
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:22,445
How much for one try?

113
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,245
Erm...

114
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:25,325
One try, one hit.

115
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:26,605
What do you want exactly?

116
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:27,965
Not injecting it.

117
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:31,885
I can't stand needles. Also
AIDS. I don't wanna die of that.

118
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:33,765
You only get AIDS if you share needles.

119
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:36,165
Anyway, these days, you
don't really die of it, so...

120
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:38,525
So, everything moves on, dunnit?

121
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:40,445
Even AIDS.

122
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:44,725
Yeah, it's probably best if
you smoke a bit in a joint.

123
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,765
It's no big deal. Chasing the dragon.

124
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:49,605
Yeah.

125
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:51,085
Okay.

126
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:52,885
Get me, err...

127
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,045
twenty quids' worth.

128
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,685
- Just want a little taster.
- Okay.

129
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:02,245
- Bring it around at seven, yeah?
- Yep.

130
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:04,325
- D'you know where I live?
- Yeah.

131
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:06,365
And keep it...

132
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:08,885
- All right?
- Okay.

133
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,565
- You ready, Jabba?
- One minute.

134
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:36,965
You get a lovely little
handful of his neck.

135
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:38,765
Like a pug.

136
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:42,125
You all right?

137
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:44,685
How's it going?

138
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:48,645
I'm still alone, angry, in pain.
I can't wait to end it all. You?

139
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:50,605
I'm fine, thanks.

140
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,367
If you're not killing yourself tonight,

141
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:53,621
still okay to look after George?

142
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:55,725
Yeah. What time did we say?

143
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:57,125
About five.

144
00:07:57,605 --> 00:07:59,454
I've got a thing with Jill.
Only be a couple of hours.

145
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:00,685
We'll be back by seven.

146
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:02,245
Seven? By seven?

147
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:04,285
I need to... I've got a thing at seven.

148
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:06,045
Yeah.

149
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,045
- Okay.
- What were you doing with his neck?

150
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:12,165
Just showing Sandy the ropes.

151
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:13,245
The consistency,

152
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,125
which is not like neck at all.

153
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:18,565
- It's more like breast or scrotum.
- Well, you're not touching them.

154
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:21,805
- You all right with that?
- Yeah, fine.

155
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:22,885
He's nodding.

156
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:25,525
- You all right with that?
- Yeah.

157
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,781
Why wouldn't she be all right
with me grabbing his neck?

158
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,965
These days, it's a minefield.

159
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:33,925
- Are you gonna do that story?
- Yeah, we're off to do it now. Come on.

160
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:37,725
Is that how you were carried
around when you were young?

161
00:08:40,245 --> 00:08:42,045
- See ya later.
- See ya.

162
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,245
See ya.

163
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,645
Wow.

164
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:07,965
Lost for words. It's just...

165
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:09,285
Um...

166
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:11,005
Err...

167
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:13,445
How long did it take
you to master the...

168
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:15,245
double-nostril recorder?

169
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:17,005
Few hours a day for a
few weeks, wasn't it?

170
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:19,805
Yeah. Blimey. Did me head in.

171
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:22,805
All worth it now, though.

172
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:25,365
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Cool.

173
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:26,525
'Cause I haven't got a job.

174
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:27,565
No?

175
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:29,645
So I've got lots of time.

176
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:30,925
Use it wisely.

177
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:34,061
Funny, 'cause it was only
this morning, I was thinking

178
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:38,125
my life was worthless, and I should
definitely kill myself, and then...

179
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:41,485
Makes you think, dunnit?

180
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:42,565
Yeah.

181
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:46,565
Get a picture?

182
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:48,845
Recorders in.

183
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:51,725
Stick em up. There ya go.

184
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,685
Fuck me.

185
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:56,701
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

186
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:57,725
Thank you.

187
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,365
Oh, fuck.

188
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:10,965
That was funny.

189
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:12,685
Was it though?

190
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,325
A fat kid who still lives
at home with his mum, no job,

191
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:19,485
so he shoves recorders up his nose
and he wants the world to know.

192
00:10:19,765 --> 00:10:21,102
Why would people rather be famous

193
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:22,685
for being shit than not famous at all?

194
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:23,765
When did that start?

195
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:25,765
It's just a bit of a
laugh. We do these stories

196
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:28,165
so people read them and go,
"Oh, that's interesting."

197
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:29,925
Like a road accident.

198
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:32,205
When you slow down on
the motorway you go,

199
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:35,005
"Oh, that's interesting.
Oh, I wish I hadn't looked."

200
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:37,805
Good how he played two at the same time.

201
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:44,365
- What did you say to the mother?
- Asked if I could call her.

202
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:46,325
- Why?
- What do you mean, "why?"

203
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:48,885
- Why would you need to call her?
- For a date.

204
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:51,125
You asked the fat
kid's mom out on a date?

205
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:52,205
Yeah.

206
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:53,805
- Unbelievable.
- Why?

207
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:55,805
Unprofessional. Embarrassing.

208
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:56,885
For who?

209
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:58,845
For me, for her, probably.

210
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,085
Well, she said yes.

211
00:11:00,165 --> 00:11:01,492
Seems odd. You meet a woman

212
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,245
who wants to get a fat kid in the paper,

213
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:04,725
and you hit on her immediately.

214
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:06,445
I've got a very high sex drive.

215
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:08,565
Okay, well never say those words again.

216
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:16,245
Oh.

217
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:17,685
It's coming this way.

218
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:21,405
Be very still and it might not see us.

219
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:26,405
Nah, we're done for.

220
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:28,245
It's stopping.

221
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:31,965
- All right?
- Hi.

222
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:39,605
Do you have weird dreams?

223
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:41,885
Erm...

224
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:44,125
- Sometimes.
- Mmm.

225
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,205
Yeah.

226
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,685
What about you?

227
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:50,325
I don't have any dreams at the
moment 'cause I'm not sleeping.

228
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:52,965
But even if I did, I
wouldn't tell them to anyone

229
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,915
because there is nothing more boring

230
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,685
than someone telling
you a dream they had.

231
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,525
See what you think of this then.

232
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,805
- She's gonna tell us anyway.
- I was looking in the mirror,

233
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:04,245
and I looked really weird

234
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:05,845
and I could pull my hair out...

235
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,005
- I know how you feel.
- And...

236
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:10,285
So I tried my teeth,
and my teeth were loose,

237
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:13,045
but then, it wasn't me, it was a baby.

238
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,605
What the hell does that mean?

239
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:17,525
Wow. You had that dream with the
baby and the teeth and the hair?

240
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:20,405
- Mmm.
- Wow, I don't know if it was Freud or Jung

241
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:23,005
that said if you have that dream
and tell other people about it,

242
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:24,405
you're really fucking boring.

243
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:25,885
Rude.

244
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:28,965
Make a good column,
though, wouldn't it, dreams?

245
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:31,845
No. I tell you what would be
good. I haven't been sleeping,

246
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,065
so if you could come around every night

247
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:35,045
and talk to me for five minutes,

248
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,565
and then sneak out
as I slip into a coma,

249
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:39,605
that'd be really good.

250
00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:42,285
Thought of another feature
for the paper, actually.

251
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:44,365
Fantasy dinner-party guests.

252
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:47,885
Brilliant, hey? Pick your top
five favorite people, and why.

253
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:49,085
Why, indeed.

254
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:51,285
Who would yours be? Five
people, dead or alive.

255
00:12:51,365 --> 00:12:52,405
Dead.

256
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:54,621
- Who, though?
- Doesn't matter, as long as they're dead.

257
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:56,045
I know mine.

258
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,221
- Of course you do.
- Number one, James Corden.

259
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,565
- Fuck me.
- We could do that Carpool Karaoke.

260
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:02,165
Could you do Carpool Kamikaze?

261
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:03,685
That man can do anything.

262
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:06,125
- And does.
- I know the cool kids don't like him,

263
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:07,685
but he never stops working.

264
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:10,445
- As a chauffeur mainly.
- He's a grafter, like me.

265
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:11,845
Princess Diana.

266
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:14,605
She'd know how she died.
You know, what happened.

267
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:17,005
So we'd be able to sort
that out, once and for all.

268
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:19,725
So you've brought this
poor woman back to life

269
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:21,765
so you can quiz her about how she died?

270
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:24,885
The dead always want to tell their
story so they can be at peace.

271
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:27,805
She's not at peace. She's in a room
with you and James fuckin' Corden.

272
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:29,245
- Mr. Bean.
- Fictional.

273
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,525
Hilarious, more like.

274
00:13:30,605 --> 00:13:34,005
You've invited multimillionaire
Rowan Atkinson, right,

275
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:38,005
along to a dinner party with you,
a dead woman, and James Corden,

276
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:39,845
and you expect him to stay in character

277
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,365
for three hours as Mr. fuckin' Bean?

278
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:44,205
It's up to me who I invite.

279
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:48,805
Kevin Hart, funniest man in the world.

280
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:51,205
- That's four, innit?
- Yeah.

281
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:53,045
Michael Jackson.

282
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:56,765
James Corden would
come if Jacko walked in.

283
00:13:56,845 --> 00:13:58,885
Just fuckin' drench everyone.

284
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,525
You need to grow up.

285
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:04,725
Worst dinner party ever.

286
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:08,605
Oh, good.

287
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:10,925
Busy?

288
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:13,605
- Trying to be.
- It doesn't look like you are.

289
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:16,005
Watching her bothering us
while we're trying to work?

290
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:17,765
Can you do what I
asked you to do, please?

291
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:19,325
You're meant to be teaching Sandy...

292
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:20,485
She's learning a lot.

293
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:22,925
Please.

294
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:32,125
Right, it's going. Come on.

295
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,645
- No, come on.
- Yeah.

296
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:36,685
- This is stupid. You're gonna get hurt.
- Why?

297
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:38,685
- Because you're old!
- I'm not old.

298
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:40,885
- I'm old. Look, I'm drunk.
- Come on.

299
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,261
- I know, but that's good if you're drunk.
- No, it's stupid.

300
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:45,405
Drunk people, they sort of
bounce. All right, come on.

301
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,365
If I fall on you, I'm
not taking you to A&E.

302
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:50,685
- No. Okay.
- Right, go. Go.

303
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,125
Stupid thing!

304
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:53,701
I'm flying!

305
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:56,445
Yes!

306
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:58,725
Let go, sweetie. Let go.

307
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:01,965
Whoa! Argh!

308
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:11,565
So what sort of journalism
are you interested in?

309
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:13,765
You don't have to babysit me.

310
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:16,365
I'm happy to just sit here.

311
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:19,085
I like peace and quiet.

312
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,565
I live at home with my mum,
dad, brother and sister, so...

313
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:24,925
the house can be quite full of life.

314
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,325
What?

315
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:30,125
- I'm sorry.
- What? What's the matter?

316
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,165
You're sad.

317
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:34,845
It's fine, seriously.

318
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:38,525
I was married for 25
years. It was brilliant.

319
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:41,205
Now it's over. It's not your problem.

320
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:43,885
- Did you not want any kids?
- No.

321
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:48,365
Annoying little fuckers.

322
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:51,885
You can still be happy.

323
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:53,485
I'll try, but stop crying

324
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:55,485
because people will
think I said summat awful.

325
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:57,405
- Okay.
- Okay. Shhhh.

326
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,525
See, this is why I don't want kids.
They're too snotty and pathetic.

327
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:04,405
Oh!

328
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:05,885
I think he's gonna eat. Watch this.

329
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:28,901
He told you to watch me eat, didn't he?

330
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:29,925
Yeah.

331
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:32,125
- Thoughts?
- It's fine.

332
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:35,405
No, exactly. I put the food in my gob,

333
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:37,645
I chew it, I swallow it,
just like everyone else.

334
00:16:37,725 --> 00:16:40,645
But from here, it looks
like that super photography

335
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:42,971
when they sort of magnify a snail,

336
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:45,725
like one thousand
times, eating a cabbage.

337
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,685
No, nothing like that. You'd
never catch me eating cabbages.

338
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:50,685
My granddad never used to eat cabbages.

339
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:53,245
Did he die of diabetes like he's gonna?

340
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:54,405
No, bowel cancer.

341
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,725
Do you get any fiber in your diet?

342
00:16:58,805 --> 00:16:59,805
Yeah, loads.

343
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:01,965
- What fruit and veg?
- Meant to have five a day.

344
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:04,205
- How many portions do you have a day?
- Ten.

345
00:17:04,285 --> 00:17:05,845
- Potatoes don't count.
- None, then.

346
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:28,685
- Oh, my God, Tony!

347
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:32,485
- You're such a dick!
- Oh!

348
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,261
- That's really good.
- Thanks.

349
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:35,821
I like to think that I helped...

350
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:37,725
Yeah, that bit.

351
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:39,701
You can sign that bit.

352
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,725
Yeah, where I jumped.

353
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,045
- Hey. You all right?
- Good. All right, George?

354
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,085
- So I'll be back about seven.
- Make sure it is. I've got that thing.

355
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:55,085
- Okay, no worries. See you then.
- Yep.

356
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:56,925
Be a good boy for Uncle Tony, George!

357
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:02,165
Um, maybe don't bring up the
wanting to kill yourself thing.

358
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:04,365
As if I would.

359
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,645
Sorry. Yeah, I know. Okay.

360
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:09,125
What if he brings it up?

361
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:11,565
Why would he bring it up?

362
00:18:12,645 --> 00:18:13,645
He wouldn't.

363
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:14,965
It was a joke.

364
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:16,045
Oh.

365
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:19,085
- All right, see ya later.
- See ya later.

366
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,605
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes, please.

367
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:33,085
Whiskey?

368
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:36,285
And we've got... Oh.

369
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:38,485
Coke?

370
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:47,885
Daddy says you're sad
since Auntie Lisa died.

371
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:49,685
Yep.

372
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,045
I'm sad, too.

373
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:53,725
I dream about her sometimes.

374
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:56,085
Me too.

375
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:58,125
Why didn't the doctors make her better?

376
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:01,085
They tried.

377
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,365
Why didn't Jesus save her?

378
00:19:03,445 --> 00:19:04,925
'Cause he's an arsehole.

379
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,565
- Don't tell your mum and dad I said that.
- I won't.

380
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,125
- You had your tea?
- No.

381
00:19:11,765 --> 00:19:13,245
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

382
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:15,445
Shall we go to the cafe?

383
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:18,285
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Come on then.

384
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:22,285
- You got any money?
- No.

385
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:23,565
Loser.

386
00:19:27,045 --> 00:19:29,125
What d'you fancy?
- Mmm...

387
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:31,205
Fish fingers and beans.

388
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:32,285
Good choice.

389
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:34,045
Think I'll have that.

390
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:38,245
- What can I get for ya?
- We're having the fish fingers and beans.

391
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:40,565
That's only on the
children's menu, I'm afraid.

392
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:42,125
Yeah, I'm not very hungry.

393
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:43,805
I can't let you order that.

394
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:45,525
What do you mean?

395
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:47,325
It's for children.

396
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:49,805
But... I can eat what
children eat, can't I?

397
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:51,285
Yeah, but it's only £4.99.

398
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:53,805
Yeah, I know, 'cause
it's a smaller portion.

399
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:56,205
I'm paying child's prices,

400
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:58,125
but I'm getting a children's portion.

401
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:01,405
Yeah, but we made it
cheaper 'cause it's for kids.

402
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:03,405
I know, 'cause they're smaller.

403
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:05,925
It's smaller 'cause they're
smaller. It's not a concession.

404
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,630
It's not 'cause they're
unemployed, is it?

405
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:09,325
And also, an adult's paying, so...

406
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:10,405
It's the rules.

407
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:13,565
- Is it?
- Mmm.

408
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,165
Right.

409
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:17,965
Well, he'll have fish
fingers and beans...

410
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:19,045
twice.

411
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:22,925
- You'll just eat one of them, won't ya?
- Nah.

412
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:24,525
So what are you ordering?

413
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:26,965
As I say, I'm not very hungry,
so I'll just get a coffee.

414
00:20:32,725 --> 00:20:33,725
Both for him, are they?

415
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:43,445
- That good?
- Mm.

416
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:49,365
Mmm.

417
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:06,045
Fuckin' 'ell.

418
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,885
Where's your fuckin' dad?

419
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:11,125
Oh. Oh, no.

420
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:13,525
Please don't be Julian.
Please don't be Julian.

421
00:21:15,165 --> 00:21:16,165
Yes!

422
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,285
- George!
- I'm sorry, erm...

423
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,005
It's all right. See ya later.

424
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:22,725
- Cheers.
- There he is. All right?

425
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:24,221
- See you tomorrow.
- All right?

426
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:25,245
- Yeah, good.
- Yeah?

427
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:27,765
- Had a good time?
- Yeah, good. Off you... Fuck.

428
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,405
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Because...

429
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:33,765
he's come around to talk about
getting started on the paper.

430
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:36,165
- Not this.
- Oh, right.

431
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:37,325
- Great.
- Exactly.

432
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:39,045
- Right...
- Got a takeaway?

433
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,125
It's drugs.

434
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,605
- You don't need to answer...
- What?

435
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:43,525
And it's seven, so go.

436
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:45,325
- Okay.
- Come in.

437
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:47,205
Was that all right?

438
00:21:47,245 --> 00:21:49,485
Why would you say drugs?
