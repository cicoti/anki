2
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:12,445
I've had the best life.

3
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:15,365
And I couldn't have
wished for a better bloke.

4
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,405
But the world's gonna
carry on without me,

5
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:20,565
and so are you.

6
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:22,885
Have fun.

7
00:00:26,645 --> 00:00:28,605
And I want you to meet someone else.

8
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:33,605
Someone nearly as lovely as me.

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,285
Nearly.

10
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:38,365
- Hello.
- Hello, you.

11
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:39,645
- You all right?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:41,205
- What are you doing?
- Twitter.

13
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:01,285
Right. Got a good lead for you.

14
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:02,885
Local baby...

15
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:04,685
looks exactly like Adolf Hitler.

16
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:09,325
Ooooh! Hey!

17
00:01:09,405 --> 00:01:11,165
Boo boo boo boo boo!

18
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:13,245
Yeah!

19
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:14,325
Boo!

20
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,205
So... is that a birthmark?

21
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,525
Oh, no, it's eyeliner.

22
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:21,125
We did it with marker pen at
first, but it took ages to get off.

23
00:01:21,205 --> 00:01:23,445
Yeah, I mean, this way
we can do it when we want

24
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:25,565
then wipe it off if we need to.

25
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:28,245
So hold on, it doesn't
really look like Hitler then.

26
00:01:28,325 --> 00:01:29,565
It does.

27
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:32,205
No. I mean naturally.

28
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:34,765
It wasn't born with
its hair combed forward

29
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,525
and a mustache, was it?

30
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:38,925
- Nor was Hitler, to be fair.
- Good point.

31
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:41,885
What I'm saying is, it's
not a revelation, is it?

32
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:44,525
I mean, to get in the paper.

33
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:47,605
"Baby born that looks
a bit like Hitler,"

34
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:49,325
mildly interesting...

35
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:51,605
if it had a real mustache.

36
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:56,005
But you can draw a mustache on any
baby and it looks a bit like Hitler.

37
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:57,165
Not a black one.

38
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:58,805
Not as much.

39
00:01:58,885 --> 00:01:59,885
No.

40
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:01,405
Well, then you'd probably...

41
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:03,925
do a little Robert
Mugabe... or something.

42
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:06,925
Yeah, or Chinese one.
We'd probably do...

43
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:08,925
- Kim Jong-Un or something.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:10,125
Or a Korean one, even.

45
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:11,701
I've got one more question.

46
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:14,485
Why do you want your baby
to look like Adolf Hitler?

47
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,445
You're not fans, are you?

48
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,685
We're not Nazis, no.

49
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:21,605
- Just... a bit of fun, innit? I mean...
- Yeah.

50
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:23,805
Hitler's the funniest
thing to do, I guess.

51
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,085
- Take a picture.
- Yep.

52
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:31,285
Smile.

53
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:38,220
So... will people do literally anything

54
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,445
to get in the local paper, then?

55
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,525
It's a laugh, innit?

56
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:43,005
- It was funny.
- Yeah.

57
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,125
See?

58
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:53,365
They should get him a passport now,

59
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:55,445
so he's stuck with that
photo for ten years.

60
00:02:57,205 --> 00:02:58,645
Oh, here she is.

61
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:00,125
- Right.
- Go on.

62
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:01,501
- If you were atheist...
- I am.

63
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:03,565
- ... and don't believe in an afterlife...
- I don't.

64
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:06,645
If you don't believe in
heaven and hell and all that,

65
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:09,765
why don't you just go around raping
and murdering as much as you want?

66
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:11,245
I do.

67
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,325
What?

68
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:14,164
I do go around raping and murdering

69
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:16,365
as much as I want, which is not at all.

70
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:18,805
'Cause he's got a conscience.

71
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:22,565
But... if death is just
the end, what's the point?

72
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:24,365
- What's the point in what?
- Livin'!

73
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,325
You might as well just kill yourself.

74
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:29,125
So if you're watching a movie,
and you're really enjoying it,

75
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:31,685
- something with Kevin Hart in...
- Yeah.

76
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:34,645
And someone points out
that this'll end eventually,

77
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:37,000
do you just go, "Oh, forget
it then. What's the point?"

78
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,445
and just turn it off?

79
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,645
No, 'cause I can watch it again.

80
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:43,525
Well, I think life is precious
'cause you can't watch it again.

81
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:46,725
I mean, you can believe in an
afterlife if that makes you feel better.

82
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:48,005
Doesn't mean it's true.

83
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:51,085
But once you realize you're
not gonna be around forever,

84
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:54,125
I think that's what
makes life so magical.

85
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:56,805
One day you'll... eat your last meal,

86
00:03:57,325 --> 00:04:00,205
smell your last flower, hug your
friend for the very last time.

87
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:02,125
You might not know it's the last time,

88
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:06,325
so that's why you should do everything
you love with passion, you know?

89
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:09,245
Treasure the few years
you've got because...

90
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:11,125
that's all there is.

91
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:15,325
I've watched Ride Along 2 five times.

92
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:17,901
- Well, you haven't wasted your life, then.
- Definitely not.

93
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:18,925
No.

94
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,125
- Love Kevin Hart, everythin' about him.
- Yeah.

95
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,205
His humor, his comedy...

96
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:26,525
- his films...
- Comedy films, mainly.

97
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:28,085
- Mainly, yeah.
- Yeah.

98
00:04:28,165 --> 00:04:29,885
- Whatever gets you through.
- Yeah.

99
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:31,285
Well, thanks for coming over.

100
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:33,565
Pleasure.

101
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:37,885
Right.

102
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,525
Is this the service for Julian Kane?

103
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:49,725
It's already happened.

104
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,445
Are you a relative?

105
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,085
No, friend.

106
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,285
Wasn't much of a do.

107
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:56,365
Terrible turnout.

108
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:58,245
Hope mine's not like that.

109
00:04:58,325 --> 00:04:59,325
Sure.

110
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:01,845
I mean, I look forward to these
things, and then that happens.

111
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,005
- It's depressing.
- Well, maybe the next one will be more fun.

112
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:06,325
Doubt it.

113
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:08,005
Cot death.

114
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:24,685
Friend of yours?

115
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,965
Yeah. A... guy I used to work with.

116
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,485
Ah, I'm sorry.

117
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:32,285
Oh, don't breathe in the smoke,
love. You'll be off your tits.

118
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:34,005
Trust me.

119
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:40,285
- Hey.
- I missed it.

120
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:42,085
Everyone did.

121
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:43,685
Doesn't matter.

122
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:45,605
How've you been?

123
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,845
Yeah, good.

124
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,285
The nurse who looks
after my dad, I'm gonna...

125
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:55,885
ask her out.

126
00:05:57,285 --> 00:05:58,685
- That's brilliant.
- Is it?

127
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:00,045
Yeah.

128
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,565
Another good man taken.

129
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:02,645
Well...

130
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:04,205
she hasn't said yes yet.

131
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:05,325
She will.

132
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:07,525
She'd be mad not to.

133
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:09,805
I don't suppose you'll have time

134
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:12,165
to associate with me when
you're all hooked up again.

135
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:13,245
Stupid.

136
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:14,765
Trust me.

137
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,285
It gets complicated.

138
00:06:16,365 --> 00:06:18,646
No one wants their fella
hanging out with someone like me.

139
00:06:19,405 --> 00:06:20,405
Like you.

140
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:22,725
A really nice person.

141
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:30,765
- See you later.
- See you later.

142
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:02,845
All right, Dad?

143
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:12,605
The soldiers were here again today.

144
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:19,245
Were they?

145
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:20,645
Yeah.

146
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:22,645
Looking for me.

147
00:07:23,645 --> 00:07:25,005
I kept out of the way.

148
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,285
Were they British or German?

149
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:31,845
German.

150
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:35,405
Nazis, then?

151
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:37,365
Yep.

152
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:40,765
Best keep out the way...
'til the war's over.

153
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,285
You're a good boy.

154
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:48,525
- Am I?
- Yeah.

155
00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:53,245
What's my name?

156
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:54,805
Charlie.

157
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:56,525
Yep.

158
00:07:57,325 --> 00:07:58,325
How do you know me?

159
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,565
Well, you come here sometimes.

160
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:05,605
Yep, I come here sometimes.

161
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:17,925
You're my boy.

162
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:22,005
Yep.

163
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,605
You drew on the wallpaper, didn't ya?

164
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:30,565
I did, yeah.

165
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:32,205
When I was seven.

166
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:34,085
You remember that?

167
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,765
Your mum's furious.

168
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:39,565
She was.

169
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:41,645
Don't worry about it.

170
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:44,885
Got a spare roll down the shed.

171
00:08:45,845 --> 00:08:47,085
I'll do it tomorrow.

172
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:50,965
You did it already, Dad.

173
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,565
- You did it the next day.
- Yeah.

174
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:56,045
I'll do it tomorrow.

175
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,125
I love you, Dad.

176
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:05,845
Gay.

177
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:16,125
... falling down the back. If
you sit forward, I'll pull it up.

178
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:27,845
Okay, right.

179
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:30,405
I don't wanna do this anymore.

180
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,285
I don't see the point.

181
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:37,605
Well, I mean, therapy is a way of
helping you cope with your feelings.

182
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:38,685
How?

183
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:39,820
You're asking the question,

184
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:42,005
which means you're on the
way to problem-solving.

185
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:43,085
Am I?

186
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:44,165
That's a great question.

187
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,645
That's a great question, Tony.

188
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:49,325
We are here to help you change...

189
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:53,325
the negative behavior which
contributes to your problems.

190
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:54,565
What is my negative behavior?

191
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:56,525
You've said yourself,
you wanna punish the world

192
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:58,645
- as a result of your loss.
- Yeah.

193
00:09:58,725 --> 00:10:00,765
Some people deserve to be punished,

194
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:01,845
including me.

195
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:05,045
And I thought I could be the
one to administer the punishment,

196
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,485
but my mistake was thinking
that everyone is an arsehole,

197
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:09,565
and they're not.

198
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,605
Some people are nice, right?

199
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:15,445
And the trick is to find who's
nice and who's an arsehole.

200
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:18,045
But arseholes are clever.
They pretend to be nice.

201
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,125
They pretend to care about you, that...

202
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:21,205
You're an arsehole.

203
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:22,845
So I'm clever.

204
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:25,525
Yeah.

205
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:30,565
- So you wanna punish me?
- I don't, actually.

206
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:31,670
- No.
- No.

207
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:34,605
I just... don't need you around anymore.

208
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:35,725
I don't...

209
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:38,605
I don't need you anymore.

210
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:40,525
Okay.

211
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,325
You're not terrible, you know.

212
00:10:43,365 --> 00:10:44,365
You're not Hitler.

213
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:46,405
You're a dickhead.

214
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:47,525
You're a dick.

215
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:50,405
You feel better, Tony?

216
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:53,605
I do. Maybe there's
something in this, yeah.

217
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:54,925
You absolute cock.

218
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:56,965
You cock, you twat.

219
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:03,205
It was your brother-in-law Matt
that told me about you, and uh...

220
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:06,021
we thought it would be a good idea...

221
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:07,565
And I went along with it for a while.

222
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:10,141
I don't know why. Like wiggling
a tooth. I knew you were a cock,

223
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:12,965
- but I just thought I'd give it...
- Well, it seems to be helping him,

224
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:15,445
what with his marriage going
down the fucking swanny.

225
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:16,725
His what?

226
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:19,045
Sorry. Naughty.

227
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:36,805
Is everything okay with you and Jill?

228
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:38,885
What?

229
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:41,605
The psychiatrist said you
were having marriage problems.

230
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:44,245
- Well, he shouldn't have done that.
- I know. He's a twat.

231
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:45,765
Is it true?

232
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:48,525
Yeah, we are.

233
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:51,685
What, you're... What? You're
working it out, though?

234
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:53,365
Well, we're trying to, yeah.

235
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:55,525
So you're not gonna...
split up or anything?

236
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:57,205
- Just gonna...
- Well, maybe.

237
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:58,285
Really?

238
00:11:58,325 --> 00:11:59,325
Oh, come on. Wha...

239
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:01,631
Is it genuinely a revelation to you

240
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:03,485
that other people have problems, Tony?

241
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,245
Because they do. Everyone does.

242
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,045
Most people keep these
things to themselves.

243
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:09,005
They don't go around
broadcasting it like you do,

244
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:10,885
but everyone has bad
shit in their lives.

245
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,725
So the next time you're
rude to some waitress

246
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:15,525
for getting your order wrong,
or make someone feel bad

247
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:16,616
for saying something stupid,

248
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:19,405
just know that they might
have just failed an exam,

249
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:22,085
or been made redundant, or
found out their mum's got cancer.

250
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:25,845
- What about George?
- What, like I haven't thought of that?

251
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:27,741
He doesn't know anything's wrong.

252
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:30,485
To be honest, he's more worried
about his uncle acting mental,

253
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:32,365
threatening to kill
himself and other people.

254
00:12:32,405 --> 00:12:33,405
Well...

255
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:36,645
tell him he doesn't have to
worry about that... at least.

256
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:37,725
That's not gonna happen.

257
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:40,805
I'm not gonna tell him something
that might turn out to be a lie.

258
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,205
I'm not gonna kill myself.

259
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:45,925
Okay.

260
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:48,805
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:50,045
No, you didn't know.

262
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:52,445
No, not about this. I mean...

263
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:54,925
about everything.

264
00:12:56,605 --> 00:12:57,645
Been a fuckin' pain.

265
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:02,845
I like this job.

266
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:06,565
I just used to be better at
it. Used to... try harder.

267
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:07,645
But it's...

268
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:11,165
it's a good place to work.

269
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:14,365
Even with these idiots.

270
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:17,165
And the little things do matter.

271
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:21,685
This shitty little...
free, local newspaper.

272
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:24,285
It kills a few minutes,

273
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:25,685
in a good way.

274
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,805
A smile 'cause someone saved
a blind kitten from a tree.

275
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,805
It's not for reading, it's for being in.

276
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:36,125
Everyone should be in the
local paper at least once.

277
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:38,085
"I was 'ere."

278
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:41,165
It's sweet.

279
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:46,685
Cheers, Lenny.

280
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:48,165
What for?

281
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:50,245
For being my human stress ball.

282
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:52,245
Letting me squeeze your neck.

283
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,805
What a good fuckin' mate you are!

284
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,085
Welcome.

285
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,285
You're brilliant, Sandy.

286
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:01,125
Smart,

287
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:02,205
interested.

288
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:03,405
Don't ever lose that.

289
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:05,605
You can do whatever you want.

290
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:09,005
And Kath.

291
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:12,725
Thank you for annoying me every day,

292
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:14,165
without fail.

293
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:16,765
Your banal questions...

294
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:18,525
they distracted me.

295
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,685
So, cheers.

296
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:25,805
Dunno what he's on about.

297
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:27,365
I think he's being nice.

298
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:30,125
Hmm. That's even weirder.

299
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,125
And...

300
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,725
cheers, Matt.

301
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:35,765
Thanks for never giving up.

302
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:40,565
It must have been like
trying to free an injured,

303
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:43,405
angry rat from a trap.

304
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:47,565
You're doing it for its own
good, but it doesn't know that

305
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:49,525
'cause it doesn't
trust anyone anymore...

306
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:51,885
so it lashes out.

307
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:54,765
You can't change the world,

308
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,965
but you can... you can change yourself.

309
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:02,645
I'll try harder at that as well.

310
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:04,685
I'll stick around.

311
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:06,085
So,

312
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:07,485
I mean, I won then?

313
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:10,805
- Won what?
- I kept you alive long enough

314
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:12,121
to decide you weren't
going to kill yourself

315
00:15:12,122 --> 00:15:13,805
and you could be happy again.

316
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:15,725
Happy's a stretch.

317
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:19,325
But you don't have to
confiscate my shoelaces anymore.

318
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:21,005
Okay.

319
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:24,445
Get back to work.

320
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,845
Unless you've got
somewhere better to be.

321
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,645
I have got somewhere better to be.

322
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,765
Oh, back again.

323
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:35,365
Hi. Umm...

324
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:40,245
I was wondering if
you wanted to go out...

325
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:41,805
for a drink...

326
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:43,085
or a meal.

327
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:45,165
Oh, uh...

328
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:47,885
I'm not mad anymore.

329
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,325
I'm a bit mad.

330
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,525
But, no madder than anyone else.

331
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:55,005
I don't know if it's the
right thing. I just...

332
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:56,085
Okay.

333
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:00,005
Well, I mean... Can I
say I'll think about it?

334
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:01,205
Yep.

335
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:02,565
I'll take that.

336
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:04,605
Think about it. That's good.

337
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,125
There's hope.

338
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:07,885
Hope is everything.

339
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:11,765
I don't know what to say.

340
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,845
Just say yes.

341
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:34,965
I asked her out.

342
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:37,565
The nurse?

343
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,845
Oh, excellent!

344
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:42,165
She's thinking about it, so...

345
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:46,525
How are you?

346
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:48,845
I mean...

347
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:50,805
are you...

348
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,485
- Am I happy?
- Yeah.

349
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:56,845
Yes.

350
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:01,645
I had the most wonderful life with Stan.

351
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:04,685
And I have all those memories.

352
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,405
That's all we are
anyway, really, memories.

353
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:12,605
And Stan had a wonderful life, too,

354
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:14,165
and he's not in any pain.

355
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:17,125
Doesn't even know it's over.

356
00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:18,725
I do.

357
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:21,925
But I'd rather live...

358
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:23,645
missing him...

359
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,085
than for him to live missing me.

360
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:27,605
That's how much I love him.

361
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:29,525
I wouldn't change anything.

362
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:33,784
If I went back and changed
one thing I didn't like,

363
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:35,725
I might lose something

364
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:38,165
that that bad thing
eventually took me to.

365
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:39,885
You shouldn't regret anything,

366
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:45,725
or think, "Well, if I went back, I
might do this or I might do that."

367
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,005
I'd go back to 1998...

368
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:53,325
and punch Gavin Tilley in
the face for looking at Lisa.

369
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,325
- For looking at her?
- It was the way he looked at her.

370
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:57,605
He winked.

371
00:17:59,565 --> 00:18:00,645
She ignored it.

372
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:02,205
I pretended I hadn't seen it.

373
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:04,965
I knew it was wrong to punch him, but...

374
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,445
Also, I think I was embarrassed

375
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:11,165
about being jealous
over something, so...

376
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:14,005
But now I wish I'd
punched him in the face.

377
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:18,805
I found myself...

378
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:22,205
ranting about how life's
worth living today at work

379
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:24,285
for the first time since Lisa died,

380
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,165
and... that's your fault.

381
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:30,445
And I thought...

382
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:32,485
I'm gonna carry on...

383
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:36,445
saying and doing... what I want, and...

384
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:39,605
punishing the world, but I'm
gonna punish people who deserve it.

385
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,365
I'm gonna use my superpower for good.

386
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:44,765
'Cause...

387
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:48,165
when I was doing and saying
exactly what I wanted,

388
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:50,605
it always felt better...

389
00:18:51,245 --> 00:18:53,285
when it was also the right thing to do.

390
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:56,445
Know what I mean? If
you're a good person,

391
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:01,205
doing things you want to do
is the same as doing good.

392
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,325
And you're a good person,

393
00:19:04,405 --> 00:19:06,725
and I'd really rather
you didn't kill yourself.

394
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:09,965
Because it would be a waste.

395
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,965
You may not like living much,

396
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:16,445
but you make the world a better place.

397
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:19,965
And don't give up...

398
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:21,725
because then they've won.

399
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:24,485
And they grow in numbers.

400
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,725
- Who?
- Arseholes, you know, like Gavin fuckin' Tilley.

401
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:31,965
Gavin fuckin' Tilley.

402
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,405
Ugh.

403
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:31,525
Are you gonna go for a drink with him?

404
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:33,405
Oh, I dunno.

405
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:34,805
Do you like him?

406
00:23:35,805 --> 00:23:39,485
D'you know, I've worked
in this job for...

407
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:41,045
God, 25 years,

408
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:45,045
and, I mean, I've seen lonely
people, people dying, people in pain,

409
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,685
people who've got nothing, and yet I...

410
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:51,725
I don't think I've ever met
anyone quite as... sad as him.

411
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,725
And he did it to himself. It's like...

412
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:58,805
I dunno, he's... he's tried to,
like, turn his heart into stone

413
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:02,245
so that he wouldn't actually feel
anything 'cause it was just all...

414
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:04,885
really painful for him.

415
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:06,725
And yet,

416
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,205
he still manages to make me laugh.

417
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:15,205
- Hi.
- Hi.

418
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:20,205
Right, let's go for that drink, then.

419
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:22,045
- Really?
- Yeah.

420
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,925
- D'you wanna go to the pub or...
- Thank you.

421
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:26,285
Sorry.

422
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:28,965
- Hey.
- What?

423
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:32,165
You are human.

424
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:34,565
I'm getting there.
